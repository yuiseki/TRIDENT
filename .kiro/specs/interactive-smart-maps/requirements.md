# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TRIDENT is an Interactive Smart Maps Assistant that enables users to create dynamic, AI-powered maps through natural language interactions. The system combines OpenStreetMap data with advanced AI processing to interpret user queries and generate interactive visualizations. It features a three-layer AI architecture (Surface, Inner, Deep) that processes natural language inputs, generates geospatial queries, and renders real-time map visualizations with multi-language support and disaster monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with maps using natural language queries, so that I can easily explore geographic information without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language query THEN the system SHALL process the input through the Surface Layer
2. WHEN the Surface Layer receives input THEN it SHALL determine the appropriate ability (overpass-api, apology, ask-more) for task completion
3. WHEN the system processes a valid geographic query THEN it SHALL generate an appropriate response within 10 seconds
4. WHEN the user submits a query THEN the system SHALL display the query in the dialogue interface immediately
5. IF the query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to better understand user intent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time map visualizations based on my queries, so that I can understand geographic data visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Inner Layer processes dialogue history THEN it SHALL generate TRIDENT Intermediate Language specifications
2. WHEN the Deep Layer receives specifications THEN it SHALL generate Overpass API queries for OpenStreetMap data
3. WHEN geospatial data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL convert OSM data to GeoJSON format
4. WHEN GeoJSON data is available THEN the system SHALL render it on the MapLibre GL map interface
5. WHEN multiple data layers exist THEN the system SHALL display them with distinct styling and colors
6. WHEN new map data is loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically fit the map bounds to show all relevant features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with maps in my preferred language, so that I can use the system effectively regardless of my language background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL detect the user's browser language preference
2. WHEN the language is Japanese THEN the system SHALL display Japanese interface elements and greetings
3. WHEN the language is Chinese THEN the system SHALL display Chinese interface elements and greetings
4. WHEN the language is French THEN the system SHALL display French interface elements and greetings
5. IF the language is not supported THEN the system SHALL default to English interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access disaster and humanitarian data, so that I can stay informed about global events and emergency situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes disaster-related queries THEN it SHALL integrate with ReliefWeb API for humanitarian data
2. WHEN disaster data is available THEN the system SHALL display it with appropriate visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing country-specific pages THEN the system SHALL show disaster information for that region
4. WHEN disaster data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes within the cache duration (6 hours)
5. WHEN displaying disaster information THEN the system SHALL include relevant metadata and timestamps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize map appearance and styles, so that I can view geographic data in the most suitable format for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses map style options THEN the system SHALL provide multiple map style choices
2. WHEN a user selects a different map style THEN the system SHALL apply it immediately to the current map
3. WHEN the user changes map styles THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in local storage
4. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL apply the user's previously selected map style
5. WHEN map styles are applied THEN all existing data layers SHALL remain visible and properly styled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access personalized features and save my progress, so that I can have a customized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN they SHALL have the option to authenticate via NextAuth.js
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their account information
3. WHEN authenticated users interact with the system THEN their session SHALL be managed through Prisma database
4. WHEN users access quiz features THEN their progress SHALL be tracked and stored
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL still have access to core mapping functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to cache data efficiently, so that I can experience fast response times and reduced loading delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes Overpass API requests THEN it SHALL cache responses for 6 hours
2. WHEN cached data exists for a query THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch fresh data on the next request
4. WHEN the system processes AI chains THEN it SHALL cache intermediate results where appropriate
5. WHEN users revisit previous queries THEN the system SHALL load results from cache within 2 seconds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an educational geography quiz system, so that I can test and improve my geographic knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the JGeoGLUE quiz system THEN they SHALL see geography-related questions
2. WHEN users submit quiz answers THEN the system SHALL store responses in the database
3. WHEN quiz results are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN users complete quizzes THEN their progress SHALL be tracked over time
5. WHEN displaying quiz questions THEN the system SHALL include relevant geographic context and maps

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work responsively across different devices, so that I can access maps on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads on desktop devices THEN it SHALL display the full interface with optimal layout
2. WHEN the system loads on mobile devices THEN it SHALL adapt the chat interface for smaller screens
3. WHEN users interact with maps on touch devices THEN all map controls SHALL be touch-friendly
4. WHEN the floating chat is displayed on mobile THEN it SHALL adjust padding and positioning appropriately
5. WHEN the system detects different screen sizes THEN it SHALL optimize the map and dialogue layout accordingly

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a modular architecture, so that I can maintain and extend functionality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing AI processing THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between Surface, Inner, and Deep layers
2. WHEN adding new map data sources THEN the system SHALL support integration through the existing tool framework
3. WHEN extending language support THEN new languages SHALL be addable through the constants configuration
4. WHEN modifying map visualization THEN changes SHALL be isolated to the appropriate component layer
5. WHEN updating AI models THEN the system SHALL support model switching through configuration changes
