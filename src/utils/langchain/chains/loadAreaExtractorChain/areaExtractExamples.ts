    input: `# Syria: Wild Fires - Oct 2024
Countries: Syria
Types: Wild Fire

Since October 29, 2024, there has been a marked increase in fire intensity, particularly in the Homs and Lattakia governorates. The majority of the fires have been reported in rugged mountainous and remote areas. The size and severity of certain bushfires have produced localized weather phenomena, that trap heat and generate strong winds, further exacerbating the fire situation. High wind conditions have facilitated the rapid spread of the flames, with some fires crossing highways and roads. The lack of capacity for the firemen such as vehicles and fuel are some of many other factors affecting the capacities of public services due to the continuities of Syrian crisis including the impact of different inputs (the Middle East crisis, the sanctions, climate change, etc.). Separate fires also occurred in Tartous governate however the scale of those fires was contained with minimal impact on the local population, while the fires in Homs and Lattakia could not be contained in the same manner. Until 03 November, the scale of the wildfires was limited to mountains in both the regions which grew in the following 2-3 days affecting the local population and its livelihoods.

    input: `# Dominican Republic: Floods - Nov 2024
Countries: Dominican Rep.
Types: Flash Flood, Flood

The situation in the Dominican Republic remains critical as heavy rains continue to saturate soils after several days of persistent rainfall. According to meteorological forecasts, the country is under the influence of two cold fronts and two troughs that will affect the weather during the next days, which will generate a significant rainy period in a large part of the country. Furthermore, the recent opening of dam floodgates has increased river and stream flows, raising the risk of overflows and potential flooding in both urban and rural areas. With additional rainfall expected in the coming days, soil saturation is likely to intensify. The heavy rainfall will increase the risk of flash floods, as well as flooding of rivers and ravines, especially in the north, northeast, Central Cordillera, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country. Authorities are closely monitoring conditions and adjusting alerts to respond to this high-risk scenario. ([IFRC, 19 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4111805))`,

Countries: Costa Rica
Types: Flood, Land Slide

Heavy rainfall has been affecting Costa Rica since 8 November, causing floods, river overflow and landslides that resulted in casualties and damage. According to media reports, as of 10 November, one child died in Cartago province, central Costa Rica, due to a landslide, and more than 800 people have been displaced in 180 shelters due to floods, some rivers overflowed, and several buildings have been affected. ([ECHO, 11 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4109385))

On 7 November 2024, the National Meteorological Institute (IMN) issued a Meteorological Advisory reporting that, following the indirect influence of Hurricane Rafael, the Intertropical Convergence Zone persisted over the Central American Isthmus. This phenomenon, combined with the passage of Tropical Wave #45, exacerbated soil saturation across various regions of the country, reaching critical levels in both Peninsulas, the North Pacific, South Pacific mountains, Northern Zone, Central Pacific, and Central Valley. Due to the elevated saturation levels, these areas faced significant vulnerability to potential incidents, prompting the IMN to recommend heightened preventive measures. [...]

It was determined that 1,098,668 people were directly or indirectly affected, mainly due to issues related to damage to essential infrastructure such as water, electricity, and communications. ([IFRC, 21 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4112695/))`,
