The information is now being reviewed and consolidated and will be published on the Logistics Cluster’s LCA website in the coming weeks.\n\n• Vanuatu Emergency Response:\n\no The island nation of Vanuatu declared a State of Emergency (SOE) on 5th March 2023 for the whole country after it had experienced two cyclones and an earthquake. Strong winds and substantial rains caused major flooding, damage to infrastructure, and caused power outages and communication system breakdowns across the country. Restoring energy/power, communication systems, transport systems, and shelter were priorities during the first weeks of the response.\n\no As of 10th March 2023, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) in Port Vila reported that some 251,346 people (about 80% of the population) and 30,000 households in all six provinces in Vanuatu had been exposed to the impacts of the cyclones.\n\no The PLC deployed two staff members to Vanuatu during the onset emergency to support onground logistics coordination and information management led by the Vanuatu NDMO. The team was embedded in the Logistics Section under the NDMO and supported NDMO in drafting distribution plans for the outer islands.\n\no Two Mobile Storage Units (MSUs), dispatched before the emergency response for preparedness, arrived in Port Vila on 13th March 2023 to support the current NDMO’s response efforts.",

  "summary": " The Pacific Logistics Cluster (PLC) is working to support the national coordination mechanisms in the Pacific region, which is highly prone to natural disasters due to climate change. In January and March of 2023, the PLC conducted a mission to the Federated States of Micronesia and conducted a Logistics Capacity Assessment in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In March, Vanuatu declared a State of Emergency due to two cyclones and an earthquake, and the PLC deployed two staff members to support the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) in Port Vila. Two Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) were dispatched to Port Vila to support the NDMO's response efforts.",
