Affected populations can use the services free-of-charge to power their communications devices. The ETS is working with the settlement management to improve and maintain access to the services.\n\n- The ETS, in collaboration with UNDSS, is procuring security communications equipment to upgrade the existing UHF radio repeater site for the United Nations Security Management System (UNSMS) in Gaziantep, Hatay, Sanliurfa, and Kilis, and to add two more UHF radio sites in Reyhanli and Mersin. The procurement process has been initiated. \n\n**Situation overview**\n\nThe response to the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes is led by the Government of Türkiye, coordinated through the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD).

This is partly attributed to the development of formal settlements housing people in ‘container cities’. \n\nFurther, a heavy storm hit Pazarcık district in Kahramanmaraş on 20 April, impacting earthquakeaffected people.
