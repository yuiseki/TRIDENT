As a result of insecurity along the border area, traffic between Sudan and CAR has been severely disrupted, causing a sharp increase in the price of basic commodities. Sudan supplies several towns in CAR, particularly Birao in the Vakaga Prefecture and Ndélé in the Bamingui-Bangoran Prefecture. During the rainy season from April to October, access is very challenged and supplies largely depend on Sudan. For some items, prices have doubled.
