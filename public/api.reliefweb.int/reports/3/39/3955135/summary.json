  "summary": "\n\nAs of April 18th, 2021, 8,172,189 individual refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe, with 5,044,039 registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes. Additionally, an estimated 5,352,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) are in Ukraine. UNHCR recently published a Regional Protection Analysis #2 which found that 22% of refugee households have at least one member with specific needs, and 27% of refugees are employed in low-paying jobs due to language barriers and non-recognition of qualifications. Recommendations include early identification of people at heightened risk, addressing barriers to decent employment, and disseminating information about refugee rights in the labour market. More information can be found on the UNHCR Ukraine Emergency website.",
