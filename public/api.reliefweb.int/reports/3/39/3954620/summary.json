This is according to the March 2023 Cadre Harmonisé (CH) food and nutrition analysis. The CH report projects that over half a million people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) States will face a food emergency during the projected period. Years of protracted conflict and violence continue to prevent many people in northeast Nigeria from growing the food they need or earning an income. In addition, the CH report identified the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) currency re-design policy among the key drivers of food insecurity, impacting on the functioning of markets.  \nThe devastating 2022 floods that destroyed close to 700,000 hectares of farmland across 34 states also had a severe impact on food security. Very high levels of inflation of food prices at 22.04 per cent have also undermined people’s ability to procure food, exacerbated by prolonged nationwide petrol scarcity that has caused a spike in the cost of transportation and other commodities across Nigeria.",

  "summary": " In north-east Nigeria, an estimated 4.3 million people are at risk of severe hunger during the lean season (June-August) due to years of conflict and violence, the 2022 floods, and the Central Bank of Nigeria’s currency re-design policy. In addition, very high levels of inflation and petrol scarcity have caused a spike in the cost of transportation and other commodities, further exacerbating the food insecurity. US$1.3 billion is required to reach 6 million people in north-east Nigeria with humanitarian assistance in 2023.",
