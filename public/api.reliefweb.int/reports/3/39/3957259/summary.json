Also, WFP initiated a needs assessment in these provinces to identify the severity and nature of needs and better channel commodity assistance during the month of Ramadan. The remaining 34 municipalities might be assisted with cash, depending on their needs.\n\n- Between the end of February and the beginning of March, WFP and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) provided seven mobile kitchens to municipalities and governorates in Adıyaman, Hatay and Kahramanmaraş to increase the capacity to prepare cooked meals in these provinces. Each mobile kitchen continues to serve around 3,000 cooked meals per day.\n\n- In March, WFP supplied the Ministry of Family and Social Services (MoFSS) with 53,760 food packages which were distributed in camps in the worst-hit five provinces. These food packages are sufficient for 268,800 earthquake-affected people, covering the food needs of a five-person household for one week.\n\n- As part of its transition into cash assistance, WFP and the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) provided 13,024 earthquake-affected people (3,256 Turkish and Syrian households) in camps with e-vouchers (BIM cards) credited monthly with Turkish Lira (TRY) 2,500 (US$ 130) per household.",
