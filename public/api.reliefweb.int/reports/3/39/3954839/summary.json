      "body": "**Global overview**\n\n**Data as of 16 April 2023**\n\nGlobally, over 2.8 million new cases and approximately 18 000 deaths were reported in the last 28 days (20 March to 16 April 2023), a decrease of 27% and 32%, respectively, compared to the previous 28 days (20 February to 19 March 2023) (Figure 1, Table 1 in the PDF). Contrary to the overall trend, important increases in reported cases and deaths continued to be seen in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions and in several individual countries elsewhere. As of 16 April 2023, over 763 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported globally.\n\nReported COVID-19 cases are underestimates as shown by prevalence surveys. This is partly due to the reductions in testing and delays in reporting in many countries. Data presented in this report are therefore incomplete and should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, data from previous weeks are continuously being updated to incorporate retrospective changes in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths made by countries.\n\nWe present changes in epidemiological trends using a 28-day interval. This wider time window helps to account for delays in reporting, smooth out weekly fluctuations in case numbers, and continue to provide a clear picture of where the pandemic is accelerating or decelerating. Disaggregated data are still accessible on the [WHO COVID-19 dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/), where the full dataset is available for download. \n\nAt the regional level, the number of newly reported 28-day cases decreased across four of the six WHO regions: the African Region (-52%), the Western Pacific Region (-33%), the Region of the Americas (-32%), and the European Region (-28%); while case numbers increased in two WHO regions: the South-East Asia Region (+654%) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (+96%). The number of newly reported 28-day deaths decreased across four regions: the Region of the Americas (-31%), the Western Pacific Region (-64%), the African Region (-47%), and the European Region (-30%); while death numbers increased in two WHO regions: the South-East Asia Region (+210%) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (+134%).\n\nAt the country level, the highest numbers of new 28-day cases were reported from the United States of America (432 798 new cases; -45%), the Republic of Korea (286 182 new cases; +6%), the Russian Federation (259 138 new cases; -24%), France (219 428 new cases; +65%), and Brazil (212 578 new cases; +35%). The highest numbers of new 28-day deaths were reported from the United States of America (5559 new deaths; -32%), Brazil (1177 new deaths; -26%), the Russian Federation (994 new deaths; -4%), Germany (813 new deaths; -58%), and the Islamic Republic of Iran (754 new deaths; +193%).",
