Food security data showed that the prevalence of inadequate food consumption remained stable for the third consecutive month, with food prices increasing in the south and decreasing in the north. Hostilities between IRG and SBA forces escalated in late March, but no airstrikes or cross-border aerial attacks have been reported since the truce started in April 2022.",
