  "summary": " The 2023 First Round Crop and Livestock Report found that the total area planted under all crops increased by 8% from 2021/22 season to 2022/23. Rainfall was less in the southern parts of Zimbabwe, while northern provinces experienced above-normal rainfall. This stability in the cost of the minimum expenditure basket over the last three months has been a relief for poor and vulnerable households.",
