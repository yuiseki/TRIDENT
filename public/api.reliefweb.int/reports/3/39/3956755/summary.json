The security situation had deteriorated in the department of Artibonite due to the presence of armed groups, leading to the abandonment of crop fields in the communes of Dessalines and Petite-Rivière-de-l'Artibonite. The agricultural workforce moved to cultivate in more secure areas, such as Desdunes and Grande Saline, where new fields were detected.
