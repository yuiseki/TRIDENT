Ethiopians remain at the top of the list of arrivals. Out of the 1,113 arrivals on 4 May, Ethiopians recorded more than 50 per cent while other nationalities included Sudanese, Eritreans, Somalians, Americans, Syrians, Ghanaians and others in descending numerical order. As numbers are on the rise, with a total of more than 12,000 people having arrived since 21 April via Metema, most foreign nationals, after securing relevant visas, have left the border area and gone to either their respective countries/destinations or to settle in Ethiopia. Similarly, Ethiopian returnees are also moving to their places of origin within the country. The majority of those who remain at the border, however, require emergency humanitarian assistance.\n\n**Needs and Response**\n\nPrimary needs remain to include hot food, drinking water and latrines, emergency shelter, adequate health and protection services. Findings of a health partners rapid health assessment in Metema on 29 and 30 April has revealed limitations in required health services. Currently, essential and life-saving drugs and medicines in health facilities are lacking. There are also limitations in referral services to hospitals, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) at border entry points. Scaling up the health emergency interventions against identified needs is essential to avoid worsening of the situation and prevent communicable and non-communicable diseases.",
