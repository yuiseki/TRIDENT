The analysis shows that in addition to the specific circumstances in their places of origin, refugees’ intentions are also influenced by the level of access to basic services and rights in host countries and by their specific socio-demographic characteristics, with intentions to return in next three months being more likely among older persons, those with spouse or children still in Ukraine and those facing inclusion challenges in host countries.
