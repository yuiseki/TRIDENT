Over 1.6 million Afghans have arrived in the countries since August 2021. No official refugee arrivals have been recorded in Turkmenistan to date.\n\n- In 2022, UNICEF provided critical support to Afghans and host community members in the neighbouring countries, and enhanced preparedness actions in case of a potential increase of influx. Across these countries, UNICEF and partners have reached over 350,000 children with access to education and more than 325,000 children have been vaccinated against measles, among refugees and hosting communities. Over 20,000 children with severe acute malnutrition have been treated, and over 140,000 children and caregivers accessed mental health and psychosocial support.\n\n- UNICEF appealed for US$81.2 million to meet the needs of Afghan children and their families in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there was a funding gap of US$30.7 million (38 per cent). In 2023, US$66.2 million is required to continue support 1.9 million people, including 1.1 million children with essential services.
