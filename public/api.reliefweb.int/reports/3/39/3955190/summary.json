They discussed ways the international community can help end the violence and restore order inside Sudan. The UNSG further appealed for warring parties in Sudan to observe a ceasefire for at least three days so that civilians trapped in conflict zones can seek medical treatment, food and other essential supplies.\n\nThe African Union issued a [communiqué](https://peaceau.org/en/article/communique-of-the-ministerial-special-session-on-sudan-20-april-2023) following the meeting condemning the violence and calling for “an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire for a week starting from midnight East African Time on 20 April 2023, to allow for the observance of Eid al-Fitr, and pave the way for a more permanent ceasefire.”\n\nThey further demanded “the establishment of humanitarian corridors and allow for unhindered humanitarian access and evacuation of injured civilians; address urgently the rehabilitation of critical basic infrastructure, in particular, water and electricity utilities and ensure access by the civilian population to these services; respect the safety of diplomatic and humanitarian personnel; and also ensure the re-opening of all modes of transport, in particular the Khartoum International Airport.”\n\n**Staff presence and safety**\n\nUNHCR has 481 staff members currently in Sudan - 115 International Staff and 366 National Staff. Khartoum is a family duty station and there are an additional number of dependents including children. We are also particularly concerned about staff members in Darfur. All staff and dependents are accounted for.\n\nThe fighting has affected UNHCR offices and staff residences in Khartoum and Darfur, including stray bullets, mortars and looting. Many staff across the country are still sheltering in place (Khartoum and Darfur), while in other locations staff are able to operate relatively normally with precautions, including working from home and limiting movements (Gedaref, Kassala, White Nile, Blue Nile, South Kordofan, West Kordofan).",
