Following a series of attacks from non-State armed groups (NSAGs) in several localities in the Mayo-Tsanaga division since the beginning of March 2023, more than 4,000 people have been displaced to other localities in the same division.

The region is already suffering from poverty, food insecurity, disease outbreaks and socio-economic deficits.  \n\nAlthough humanitarian partners scaled up urgent response activities such as shelter, food, health, nutrition, education, water, hygiene, and sanitation as well as protection services to the most vulnerable displaced people, numerous needs remain uncovered.",

Floods and mudslides from Mount Cameroon affected over 3,000 people in the South-West, and 54% of schools remain closed in the North-West and South-West. UNHCR facilitated the voluntary repatriation of 200 refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR). The Cameroonian-based NGO Reach Out participated in the 67th Commission of the Status of Women.
