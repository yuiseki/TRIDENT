The ongoing conflict is pushing already vulnerable children and women deeper into hardship. Thousands of families are fleeing Khartoum and other cities, with many seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.  \n\n**Immediate humanitarian needs**\n\nThe fighting is severely exacerbating the already fragile humanitarian situation in the country.  \n\nHumanitarian needs had already reached record levels before hostilities broke, with 15.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 8.5 million children.  \n\nAs of 2 May, at least 550 people have been killed and 4,926 wounded across Sudan according to Federal Ministry of Health figures. Over a hundred children have reportedly been killed and nearly two thousand injured across Khartoum, the Darfurs and North Kordofan, with increasing reports of gender-based violence (GBV) against girls and women. The security situation, however, seriously hinders the ability of UNICEF and partners to collect and verify information.  \nSafe access and provision of essential supplies is severely constrained across many parts of Sudan.  \n\nHouseholds are running low on food, fuel and cash, while prices of basic commodities have risen by 40 – 60 per cent in some areas. This increases the risk of malnutrition among children, water borne diseases, displacement and exposure to violence including GBV.\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of humanitarian workers and assets remain of grave concern. Five aid workers, including four UN staff members, have been killed. Humanitarian premises have come under attack and looted, including UNICEF supplies and properties.  \n\nSudan already had one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. The fighting has disrupted lifesaving treatment services to about 50,000 children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), including 1,700 children with medical complications. Access to health care is severely disrupted. Only 16 per cent of health facilities in Khartoum are currently operating as normal.  \n\nFighting has compromised the central cold chain, including millions of lifesaving vaccines and vital medication such as insulin, with electricity supply unstable and limited access to fuel for running generators. Vaccines and cold chain equipment in West and South Darfur have been destroyed.  \n\nAccess to safe drinking water remains a major challenge in conflict-affected areas, increasing the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Several neighbourhoods in Khartoum face severe shortage of water due to power outage, lack of fuel and damage to water systems.  \n\nSchools and educational institutions in conflict affected areas are mostly closed. Out of school children are bound to increase in number and at greater risk of physical and mental threats, including recruitment into armed groups. The learning crisis is deepening as a result, with nearly 7 million school-age children already out of school before the conflict, one in three girls and one in four boys, with girls less likely to return to school.",
