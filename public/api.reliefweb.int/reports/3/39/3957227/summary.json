Acute food insecurity is also widespread in the said region and prices of food are increasing in the area.\n\n- The situation in the upcoming months is expected to worsen with expected floods and road closures due to the rainy season, leading to a potential surge in and spread of diseases such as cholera and an increase in food insecurity.\n\n- The situation is impacting the already very fragile host communities. The region is home to 17,600 internal displaced, with ongoing conflict in some parts of the territory.\n\n**HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE**\n\n- The humanitarian country team met on 24 April. UNHCR with support from OCHA is coordinating the response.\n\n- On 28 April, an interagency mission was deployed to the northern part of the country to assess the needs and have a proper estimation of the refugee population.\n\n- Based on several scenarios the humanitarian country team is expecting an influx of up to 50,000 people.",
