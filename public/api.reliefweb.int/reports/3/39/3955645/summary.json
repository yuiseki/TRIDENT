  "summary": " This bulletin provides an overview of the market prices of main commodities in Afghanistan during the third week of April 2023. Prices of rice, pulses, and sugar are high compared to the two-year average, and are expected to increase due to the approaching Eid. The purchasing power of unskilled casual labour and livestock keepers improved due to decreased wheat prices, increased labour wage, and increased sheep price. The value of Afghani against USD is slightly improved due to Zakat in Ramadan and more remittances from outside for Eid preparation, but is still lower than last year's same time and average level.",
