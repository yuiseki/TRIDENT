In the southeast, the nutritional situation is worse than forecast in the last IPC, with two districts in critic phase (global acute malnutrition above 15%). UNICEF has treated 5,577 girls and 5,358 boys for severe acute malnutrition and 28,100 children (14,300 girls and 13,800 boys) have received preventive nutrition services.\n\n- 142,700 people was supported by UNICEF during the reporting period.\n\n- UNICEF Madagascar launched a US$ 41.12 million appeal for 2023 to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of children and women.
