  "summary": " India has made progress in reducing the rate of child marriage, but it still has the highest number of child brides in the world. The prevalence of child marriage varies across states and union territories, and girls from rural areas and poorer households are more likely to be married before 18. Fewer than 2 in 10 married girls remain in school, and progress has been accelerating over the last 15 years. India is making progress compared to other countries in South Asia, but additional efforts are needed to reach the goal of eliminating child marriage by 2030.",
