  "summary": "\n\nViolence and conflict in eastern DRC has caused 6 million people to be internally displaced, with 6.1 million people already projected to be experiencing high levels of food insecurity. Intercommunity violence between the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) and Zaire militias in Ituri has caused catastrophic conditions for displaced populations, with shortages of food, nutritional inputs and basic medicines. Malnutrition is rising, and food prices have increased significantly due to the conflict. Humanitarian assistance is urgently needed to prevent further hunger.",
