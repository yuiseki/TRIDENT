Contrary to the overall trend, increases in reported cases and deaths continued\nto be seen in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions and in several individual countries\nelsewhere. As of 23 April 2023, over 764 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported\nglobally.\nReported COVID-19 cases are underestimates as shown by prevalence surveys.1–4 This is partly due to the\nreductions in testing and delays in reporting in many countries. Data presented in this report are therefore\nincomplete and should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, data from previous weeks are continuously\nbeing updated to incorporate retrospective changes in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths made by countries.\nWe present changes in epidemiological trends using a 28-day interval. This wider time window helps to account\nfor delays in reporting, smooth out weekly fluctuations in case numbers, and continue to provide a clear picture\nof where the pandemic is accelerating or decelerating.
