      "body": "**Key figures**\n\n126,711 refugees granted temporary protection in Romania (as of 2 April 2023)  \n107,706 refugees in Romania (as of 31 March 2023)  \n17,484 refugees supported with cash assistance in 2023. 43,129 refugees supported in 2022.  \n23,954 refugees provided with protection counselling services and legal support in 2023. 65,000 refugees assisted since 2022.  \n1,027 refugees supported with fast- track transfers from Moldova to Romania in 2023 and 14,636 in 2022.  \n\n**Highlights**\n\nOn 12 April the government approved a new Emergency Ordinance modifying the so-called 50/20 programme which has covered accommodation and food costs of refugees from Ukraine. On 13 April, the Ministry of Interior published a draft governmental Decision to implement the Emergency Ordinance establishing accommodation and food assistance. The draft Decision establishes that refugees who are beneficiaries of Temporary Protection in Romania can apply to be included into the new programme according to integration criteria on education and employment, to foster inclusion in Romania. Refugees included in the programme will benefit, once approved by the government, from 2,000 RON per family (750 RON for single persons) to cover accommodation and 600 RON per person per month for food, which is closer to the existing programmes for asylum-seekers and other refugees in Romania. Refugees are inquiring via hotlines and help desks on several aspects of this new system and UNHCR will develop jointly with partners harmonized guidance on addressing some queries, which will be periodically updated. UNHCR and other UN Agencies had shared proposals with authorities on the new system back in December and are liaising with them to ensure inter alia that the implementation of the proposed system includes safeguards for particularly vulnerable persons and is accessible to all those in need of it. Both in the Inter-Agency Cash and Protection Working Groups, partners are discussing on ways to support refugees during the transition period between the two assistance modalities.\n\nUNHCR continued its engagement with One World Romania, an International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival – that included films based on refugee experience. During the 16th edition of the festival, UNHCR participated as guest speaker at the post-screening debate. The Uprooted, a film featuring, and made with, Ukrainian refugees, was also screened in the opening of the festival. UNHCR has supported this festival since 2016, reaching out to thousands of viewers.\n\n**Population movements**\n\nOver the past weeks, the number of refugees from Ukraine in Romania has been decreasing, from its peak of 113,009 on 24 February, to the current 104,823 (as of 2 April). This decrease was expected by UNHCR as many of the 33,000 refugees who had arrived in winter months and had remained in Romania, expressed they had come with a view to return in spring. Pendular movements at border areas are still ongoing with an average of 7,900 individuals from Ukraine entering Romania daily and around 8,100 exiting the country over the last two weeks. The majority of refugees granted temporary protection obtained their documents in Bucharest (34,000 individuals), Maramures (11,000), Constanta (11,000) and Galati (9,500).\n\n**Response**\nUNHCR continues to provide counselling support to the refugees from Ukraine in Romania.\n\nSo far in 2023, UNHCR and partners have supported nearly 24,000 refugees with protection and counselling services both in person and remotely through hotlines. Current queries received from refugees are largely linked with the revision of the government “50/20 programme”, UNHCR’s cash assistance, and access to temporary protection.\n\nUNHCR distributed core-relief items (CRIs), including clothes, hygiene kits, bed linen, blankets, towels, diapers, and water to over 1,300 refugees from Ukraine in Iasi, Buzău, Constanța, Galați, and Tulcea counties.",
