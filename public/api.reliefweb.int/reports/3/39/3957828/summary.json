As part of WFP’s contribution to the response, the ETC in the Pacific engaged with the Government of Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Office of the Government Chief Information Office (OGCIO) to assess the situation and mobilise support to meet the ICT needs of the emergency response.\n\n- On 9 March, WFP rapidly supported and collaborated with Vanuatu government responders by deploying an ETC Officer to help assess communications and connectivity needs across the affected islands. Deployed in the initial response were three push-to-talk (PTT) satellite phones to enable voice service communications, and one Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) terminal to provide back-up connectivity for the planned ETC assessments. On 17 March, WFP through the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) brought in a second ETC Officer who arrived in Vanuatu to support assessments on communications and connectivity needs, install data connectivity terminals, and train NDMO technicians on the delivery of communications services.\n\n- On 11 and 18 April, a Starlink satellite data terminal was installed by the government with the support of the ETC at the Penama Provincial Emergency Operations Centre (PEOC) on Ambae Island and Tafea PEOC on Tanna Island. The data connectivity services enable users to communicate with the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) at the NDMO headquarters in Port Vila.
