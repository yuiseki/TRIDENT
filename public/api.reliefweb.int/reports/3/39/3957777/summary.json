  "summary": " This report provides key lessons and areas of good practice for designing inclusive and accessible early warning systems (EWS). It is aimed at development practitioners, especially World Bank staff, and provides evidence-based approaches to enhance inclusion of different social groups in EWS. The report outlines characteristics of inclusive, accessible EWS, such as being long-term social processes, using multiple channels, modes, and messages, being relevant to everyone, connecting all governance levels, and extending beyond warning dissemination. It also recommends early and anticipatory action to reduce inequalities and inequities.",
