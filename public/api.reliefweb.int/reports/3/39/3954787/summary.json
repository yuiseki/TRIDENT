  "summary": " This Policy Research Working Paper examines the link between slow-onset climate phenomena such as droughts and urbanization. Using panel data from 1985-2014, the paper shows that drought leads to faster urban growth, with a hypothetical drought lasting 12 months associated with a 27 percent increase in the average annual increment of built-up area. The paper also uses data from several Sahelian cities to illustrate that much of this growth takes the form of non-infill development.",
