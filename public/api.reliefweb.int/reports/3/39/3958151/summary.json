  "summary": "\n\nThis report examines the need for a comprehensive risk-management approach to address the complex interplay of natural hazards, climate change, pandemic threats, violence and conflict, food insecurity, and economic fluctuations. It highlights the importance of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in bridging the humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus, and calls for further exploration of the potential for DRR to contribute to conflict prevention and peacebuilding.",
