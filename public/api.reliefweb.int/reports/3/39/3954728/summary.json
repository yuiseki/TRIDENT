The supplies included interagency health kits, kits for the treatment of injuries and emergency surgeries, kits for the treatment of non-infectious diseases, paediatric kits and pneumonia treatment kits.\n\n- On 5 April, the WHO CO held a seminar in Cherkasy to improve the operation of the emergency medical care and disaster medicine system in Ukraine. The seminar was opened and attended by representatives of WHO, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ukraine and directors from the regional centre for emergency care and disaster medicine. Key findings were presented, including the fact that 12 500 people with limited access due to their location in the recently retaken areas have received medical care; and that up to 3000 people have undergone treatment abroad with support from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and international partners.\n\n\n**SITUATION UPDATE**\n\n-   As of 18 April, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported 1564 households and 330 houses remain flooded with transport connections to 30 settlements are disrupted. The seasonal water level rise occurs in the territories of Volyn, Dnipropetorvsk, Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Kirovograd, Rivna, Poltava, Cherkasy, and Chernihiv regions.\n    \n-   UN provided shelter materials and other vital items to 1500 people in a community along the Dripro River in Kherson. “This is the first time we managed to go to this area, only a couple of hundreds meters from the front line, where the level of destruction is appalling,” Denise Brown, Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine.\n    \n-   According to a sociological research result, during the year of the full-scale war, 9 out of 10 Ukrainians experienced at least on of the symptoms of psycho traumatization. According to forecasts, 40-50% of the population of Ukraine will need psychological support. To meet his need, state authorities are coordinating efforts and working out specific solutions to provide Ukrainians with high- quality and affordable state services for psychosocial support.\n    \n    “A full-scale war brings not only direct losses, but also indirect ones [...]. the topic of mental health is becoming increasingly relevant not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries. Attention to this direction is a worldwide trend that requires a comprehensive approach and timely response,” Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko.\n    \n-   The development of primary medical care, strategic procurement and medium-term contracts and management of the Medical Guarantee Program are priority areas of work for 2023-2024.
