A total of 384 households (2,112 individuals) were affected by the flooding. Among these households, the homes of 112 households were completely destroyed; these households now reside with other members of the community who were not affected by the floods. The homes of the remaining affected households (272 households) were partially damaged. At the time of data collection, these households continued to reside in these homes ... Following heavy rains, and the subsequent rise in the Bahr Azoum River's water level on the night of 30 July 2022, a total of 975 households (4,830 individuals) were affected by floods in two localities located in the sous-préfecture of Koukou Andarana (département of Koukou Andarana, province of Sila). Among these households, the homes of 390 households (1,905 individuals), residing in the locality of Koukou centre, were completely destroyed and they took refuge on a hill located in the locality considering that given its height, it would not be affected by probable flooding in coming weeks. The houses of 585 other households (2,925 individuals), residing in the locality of Habilé, were partially damaged.

([IOM, 9 Aug 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3874676))\n\nOn Friday 5 August, several neighbourhoods were flooded after heavy rains hit in the capital city of Chad, Ndjamena. According to [OCHA] the rains keep affecting various regions of the country, including the province of Logone Oriental, causing human and material damage, and loss of livelihoods to a significant part of the population. The rapid assessment conducted by Red Cross of Chad (RCC) teams between 5 and 10 August 2022 identified at least 20,657 people affected, and the number continues to rise. Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. Due to lack of real-time information, this estimate does not represent all the damage (information provisionally made available by OCHA on 5 August 2022 in the snapshot). During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital.

The worst-hit Provinces are Tandjilé (southern Chad) with 166,258 affected people, followed by Logone (147,129 people), Mandoul (82,608), and Sila (77,357). ([ECHO, 16 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3887129))\n\nIn the capital, N’Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. ([OCHA, 20 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3898702))\n\nSince September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181 720 people (28 907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes.

As of 29 of March 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that around 300,000 people were still in dire needs of assistance in several sites in N'Djamena and Bol. The Chadian government plans to close the sites in April before the start of the rainy season. Many internally displaced persons (IDPs) will have to leave the sites without any resources.

Following heavy rains, and the subsequent rise in the Bahr Azoum River's water level on the night of 30 July 2022, a total of 975 households (4,830 individuals) were affected by floods in two localities located in the sous-préfecture of Koukou Andarana (département of Koukou Andarana, province of Sila). Among these households, the homes of 390 households (1,905 individuals), residing in the locality of Koukou centre, were completely destroyed and they took refuge on a hill located in the locality considering that given its height, it would not be affected by probable flooding in coming weeks. The houses of 585 other households (2,925 individuals), residing in the locality of Habilé, were partially damaged. See page 2 for more details on the affected localities as well as an overview of the situation by sector. ([IOM, 9 Aug 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3874676))\n\nOn Friday 5 August, several neighbourhoods were flooded after heavy rains hit in the capital city of Chad, Ndjamena. According to [OCHA] the rains keep affecting various regions of the country, including the province of Logone Oriental, causing human and material damage, and loss of livelihoods to a significant part of the population. The rapid assessment conducted by Red Cross of Chad (RCC) teams between 5 and 10 August 2022 identified at least 20,657 people affected, and the number continues to rise. Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. Due to lack of real-time information, this estimate does not represent all the damage (information provisionally made available by OCHA on 5 August 2022 in the snapshot). During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital. ([IFRC, 12 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3885744))\n\nAccording to the latest report of UN OCHA, almost 623,000 people have been affected across 16 of the 23 Provinces, including the Capital N’Djamena with 44,839 affected people. The worst-hit Provinces are Tandjilé (southern Chad) with 166,258 affected people, followed by Logone (147,129 people), Mandoul (82,608), and Sila (77,357). ([ECHO, 16 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3887129))\n\nIn the capital, N’Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. ([OCHA, 20 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3898702))\n\nSince September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181 720 people (28 907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes. ([OCHA, 13 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3915936))\n\nAs of January 20, 2023, the most affected provinces are Lac with 250,091 victims, Mayo Kebbi Est with 228,708 victims, Mayo Kebi Ouest (50,022 victims), Logone Occidental (147,129 victims), Logone Oriental (10,052 victims), Tandjilé (138 831 victims), Mandoul (82,608 victims), Salamat (19,080 victims), Sila (92,600 victims), Guéra (65,047 victims), and Batha (26,466 victims).\n\n41% of the funding required for the Joint Flood Response Plan has been received (18 million) or committed (11 million, on an initial request of 69.8 million US dollars) until the end of December 2022. This amount includes the 5 million US dollars from the government's request for funding from the World Bank.([OCHA, 20 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3926433))\n\nMore than 1.4 million people were affected by floods in Chad in 2022 and many of them remain displaced in several camps in N'Djamena and Lac provinces. As of 29 of March 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that around 300,000 people were still in dire needs of assistance in several sites in N'Djamena and Bol. The Chadian government plans to close the sites in April before the start of the rainy season. Many internally displaced persons (IDPs) will have to leave the sites without any resources.
