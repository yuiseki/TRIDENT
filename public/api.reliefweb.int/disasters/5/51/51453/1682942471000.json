At the time, Niassa province recorded 379 confirmed cholera cases and six deaths in Lago, 250 in Lichinga district with two deaths reported. As of 13th January 2023, the reports from MoH showed a cumulative caseload of 878 confirmed cases and 14 deaths. This is an 80% increase from the number of cases recorded on 21 December 2022, which was 409 cases confirmed with seven reported deaths. To note, five provinces are facing the cholera outbreak or are at risk of experiencing it given the rate at which the outbreak is spreading. Concerned areas include the districts of Lago, Lichinga , Sanga, Chimbonila and Mecanhelas in Niassa province; the districts of Xai-Xai and Chilaulene in Gaza province; Tete province; Zambezia province and the districts of Caia and Buzi in Sofala province. A similar risk is also considered in other surrounding countries, mainly Malawi, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia. [...] The upcoming rainy season further poses a threat of the disease spreading nation-wide. Given the surge in cases with the floods season ahead, there is a high risk to exacerbate the Cholera situation and overall humanitarian situation in the coming weeks, until the end of the rain and cyclone season.
