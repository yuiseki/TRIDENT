        "overview": "In the afternoon of 22 December, a fire started in native forest areas in the upper part of the city of Viña del Mar (Valparaíso Region), 120 km from Santiago, Chile. On 25 December, the fire was brought under control and a yellow alert was declared for Viña del Mar. The national state maintains the state of emergency because there are still forestry fighters working in the area and the fires have caused great structural damage. So far, a total of 2,455 people (491 families) have been affected, 371 houses were completely destroyed, 312 people were injured and 2 people died.

A state of emergency has been declared in Araucanía, Biobío and Ñuble, the most affected areas. According to Chile's disaster mitigation agency, some 286,299 ha have been burned until now by the fires. At least 23 people have died in connection to the fires, while 979 have been reported injured. Hundreds of homes have reportedly been damaged or destroyed and more than 1,500 people have sought refuge in shelters.
