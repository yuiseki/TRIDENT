Rural populations in Ali Sabieh, Arta, Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil are particularly exposed to extreme deprivation and no longer able to cope due to lack of access to main basic services as water, health, and education. Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance.

More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).
