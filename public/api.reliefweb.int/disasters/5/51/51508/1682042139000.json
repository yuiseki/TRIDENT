        "overview": "In the afternoon of 5 March 2023, a massive and devastating fire broke out in Kutupalong Balukhali refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

Three-wheeler Mobile Fire Fighting Units provided by UNHCR, were deployed from across the camps and helped reach the congested areas. So far, no casualties have been reported. Some 12,000 refugees were displaced, more than 2,000 shelters were destroyed or damaged, and more than 90 facilities were damaged including hospitals and learning centres.

Based on situation reports dated 6 March 2023, more than 3,000 households or more than 15,000 individuals have been affected, with more than 5,000 individuals displaced.

Moreover, three Health facilities were destroyed, including one Health Post (HP)and two Primary Health Centers (PHCs).
