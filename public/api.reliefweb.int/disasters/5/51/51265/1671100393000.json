According to media, four people died and a number of people sustained injuries. Over 100 households have been displaced across 11 communities in Gulani and one community in Gujba. Several towns, including Gulani, Bara, Gagure, and Njibulwa, are inaccessible as the main bridge linking these areas was cut off. ([ECHO, 19 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3867612/))\n\nSince 20 June 2022, abundant rains are being recorded over localized areas in southern Nigeria, with total amount of rains exceeding 100mm per day so far. Floods have also started to be recorded in some parts of the area at risk, mainly in Northern localities and urban areas since the end of June 2022. Currently, more flash floods are recorded and general alerts are for the moment in yellow alert with close monitoring of meteorological experts issuing frequent alerts since July. [...] The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA)'s Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) predicted that 233 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 32 states of the Federation and the FCT fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risks Areas, while 212 LGAs in 35 States of the Federation including FCT fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risks Areas.

Floods have damaged houses, livestock, and food items. On 4 August, moderate rainfall is forecast over northern Nigeria (including Jigawa), while on 5 August, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is forecast for north-western and central Nigeria.

Tounga, Fufore LGAs in Adamawa state and Gujba, Geidam, and Gulani LGA in Yobe state have been the most affected areas by the floods, according to partners’ rapid needs assessments. IDPs in the flood-prone regions already using makeshift shelters or sleeping outside remain the most susceptible to the impact of the floods. Response operations are being scaled up to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, among other funding sources. More than 60 per cent of the affected households have not received any food assistance after weeks of displacement, raising concerns about the risk of people turning to negative coping strategies.

An estimated 4,347 people have been displaced, with the elderly, women and children most affected. Most of the displaced people have occupied schools. Tounga, Fufore LGAs in Adamawa state and Gujba, Geidam, and Gulani LGA in Yobe state have been the most affected areas by the floods, according to partners’ rapid needs assessments. IDPs in the flood-prone regions already using makeshift shelters or sleeping outside remain the most susceptible to the impact of the floods. Response operations are being scaled up to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, among other funding sources. More than 60 per cent of the affected households have not received any food assistance after weeks of displacement, raising concerns about the risk of people turning to negative coping strategies.
