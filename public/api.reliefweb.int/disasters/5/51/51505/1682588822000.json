Equatorial Guinea currently does not have the laboratory capacity to test for VHF, hence samples from those who were sick and from close contacts were sent to Gabon and Senegal. The samples sent for testing in Gabon were negative, but the out of the eight samples sent to Dakar, Senegal, one tested positive for the Marburg virus. On 13 February 2023, the Equatorial Guinea MoH officially [declared the outbreak](https://www.afro.who.int/countries/equatorial-guinea/news/equatorial-guinea-confirms-first-ever-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak). As of 17 February, 1 case is confirmed, 8 are probable (deaths from individuals with VHF symptoms that were not tested), and 16 suspect cases in isolation (2 are showing signs and symptoms). 21 additional are considered secondary contacts. There is restricted access to Kie Ntem district, with an estimated 4,235 people in quarantine. The affected district is located in the north-east of Equatorial Guinea mainland, bordering Cameroon and Gabon. Several suspected cases were identified in Cameroon, but all samples were negative for the Marburg virus. There is no notification of cases or symptoms related to Marburg on the Gabonese territory. ([IFRC, 1 March 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3938950))\n\nEquatorial Guinea's Ministry of Health has confirmed eight more cases of Marburg, bringing the number of confirmed cases to nine since the outbreak of the viral haemorrhagic fever was declared on 13 February. The new cases were confirmed following laboratory analysis of additional samples. So far, there are 20 probable cases and 20 deaths. The new cases have been reported from Kie Ntem in the east, Litoral in the country's west, and Centro Sur provinces, all with international borders with Cameroon and Gabon. The areas reporting cases are about 150 kilometres apart, suggesting wider transmission of the virus. ([WHO, 23 Mar 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3946146))\n\nTwo new confirmed cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) were reported on 18 and 20 April 2023, both from Bata district which is now the epicenter of the outbreak.

As of 23 April 2023, a total of 17 confirmed cases of MVD; including 12 deaths, three survivors, one case with unknown status and one case currently admitted, have been reported in Equatorial Guinea for the ongoing outbreak. In addition, 23 probable cases have been reported. The number of affected districts remains five (Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong, Nsok Nsomo and Nsork) and the number of affected provinces is still four (Centro Sur, Kie Ntem, Litoral and Wele-Nzas).
