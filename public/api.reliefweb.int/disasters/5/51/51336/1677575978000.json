The deadly illness has resurfaced as the country continues to be paralyzed by gang blockades that have triggered severe shortages of fuel, safe drinking water and limited access to health services across the country.\n\nAccess to clean drinking water and proper sanitation services are critical for preventing the spread of cholera, raising serious concerns about containing the spread of the infection as heightened insecurity and mobility challenges increasingly limit access to both for most Haitians.
