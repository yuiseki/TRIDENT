On 11 April 2022, the laboratory of the central hospital reported a suspected case of dengue fever to clinical officials, triggering such implementation of epidemiological and entomological surveillance protocols. On the same day, the Ayres Central Hospital in Menezes reported a positive case of dengue fever to officials at the Epidemiological Surveillance Department (DVE in Portuguese). The reported case was a 27-year-old Sao Tomean, whose place of residence is Portugal and who works on the island of Guadeloupe. He reportedly arrived on leave with his family on 26 March 2022. He started having symptoms (fever, headaches, and joint pain) on 4 April 2022. Initially treated at the Mezochi (Trindade) health centre, he was referred to the main central hospital because of persistent fever. The disease spread quickly to all the country districts and as of 26th August 2022, 980 cases of dengue fever were already reported. Ahead of the rainy season, there was a high probability to see a pick-up on the caseload and, given the health capacity, a risk of the outbreak getting out of hand without stronger early actions and preventive measures.
