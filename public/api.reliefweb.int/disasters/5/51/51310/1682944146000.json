Between 25 August and 10 September, the surveillance data showed that a total of 936 severe acute watery diarrhoea cases were reported in Syria, including at least eight deaths. Most of the cases were reported from Aleppo (72.2%, 676 cases), Deir-ez-Zor (21.5%, 201 cases), Ar-Raqqa (1.8% 17 cases), Al Hasakeh (4.1%, 38 cases), Hama (0.2%, 2 cases) and Lattakia (0.2%, 2 cases). The number of confirmed cholera cases so far is 20 in Aleppo, four in Lattakia and two in Damascus (people coming from Aleppo). Based on a rapid assessment conducted by health authorities and partners, the source of infection is believed to be linked to people drinking unsafe water from the Euphrates River and using contaminated water to irrigate crops, resulting in food contamination. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3885666))\n\nSuspected cholera cases (AWD) have been reported from all 14 governorates, of which 12 have reported cases that were positive by rapid diagnostic test. Between 25 August and 8 October, 15,823 suspected cases have been reported, including 68 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.43%). Of the 1,635 samples tested with rapid diagnostic tests, 807 have tested positive. To date, 644 stool samples have been cultured, of which 245 have tested positive for Vibrio Cholera.
