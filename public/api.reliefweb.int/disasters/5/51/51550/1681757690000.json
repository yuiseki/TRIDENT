Furthermore, an orange level (II) means that, given the changes in the volcano's activity, there is a probability that in days or weeks the Nevado del Ruiz volcano will erupt, and it’s expected to be more than it has done in the last decade. In the worst-case scenario, the alert level could change from orange to red (III), indicating that the volcano is in the process of erupting or is going to erupt any time, representing the highest level of alert.
