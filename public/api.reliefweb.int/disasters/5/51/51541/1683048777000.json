The following day on 19 March, OCHA facilitated a joint mission with humanitarian partners, including some United Nations agencies, Cluster representatives, national and international NGOs, to the affected areas for an overview of the situation and an assessment of the most urgent needs. Preliminary findings revealed that two persons were found dead, four were hospitalized and one was reported missing. An estimated 3,000 people are affected. Some households lost their livelihood and personal belongings including livestock, stored grains, crops and civil documents. The water catchment in Buea-town neighborhood was also destroyed and water supply pipes were broken in all affected communities, depriving them from access to water. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), as well as shelter, non-food items (NFIs), health and protection were reported as the most immediate needs. The community, the Government, humanitarian organizations and the private sector provided lifesaving support to the affected population. ([OCHA, 2 May 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3957657))",
