A function that takes `z integer` (or `zoom integer`), `x integer`, `y integer`, and an optional `query json` and returns `bytea`, can be used as a Function Source. Alternatively the function could return a record with a single `bytea` field, or a record with two fields of types `bytea` and `text`, where the `text` field is an etag key (i.e. md5 hash).\n\n| Argument                   | Type    | Description             |\n|----------------------------|---------|-------------------------|\n| z (or zoom)                | integer | Tile zoom parameter     |\n| x                          | integer | Tile x parameter        |\n| y                          | integer | Tile y parameter        |\n| query (optional, any name) | json    | Query string parameters |","metadata":{"source":"https://github.com/maplibre/martin","name":"martin","fullName":"maplibre/martin","authorUrl":"https://github.com/maplibre","author":"maplibre","title":"maplibre/martin; Blazing fast and lightweight PostGIS, MBtiles and PMtiles tile server","licence":"","loc":{"lines":{"from":336,"to":345}}}}],["726",{"pageContent":"For example, if you have a table `table_source` in WGS84 (`4326` SRID), then you can use this function as a Function Source:\n\n```sql, ignore\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_zxy_query(z integer, x integer, y integer) RETURNS bytea AS $$\nDECLARE\n  mvt bytea;\nBEGIN\n  SELECT INTO mvt ST_AsMVT(tile, 'function_zxy_query', 4096, 'geom') FROM (\n    SELECT\n      ST_AsMVTGeom(ST_Transform(ST_CurveToLine(geom), 3857), ST_TileEnvelope(z, x, y), 4096, 64, true) AS geom\n    FROM table_source\n    WHERE geom && ST_Transform(ST_TileEnvelope(z, x, y), 4326)\n  ) as tile WHERE geom IS NOT NULL;\n\n  RETURN mvt;\nEND\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE;","metadata":{"source":"https://github.com/maplibre/martin","name":"martin","fullName":"maplibre/martin","authorUrl":"https://github.com/maplibre","author":"maplibre","title":"maplibre/martin; Blazing fast and lightweight PostGIS, MBtiles and PMtiles tile server","licence":"","loc":{"lines":{"from":347,"to":363}}}}],["727",{"pageContent":"```sql, ignore\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_zxy_query(z integer, x integer, y integer, query_params json) RETURNS bytea AS $$\nDECLARE\n  mvt bytea;\nBEGIN\n  SELECT INTO mvt ST_AsMVT(tile, 'function_zxy_query', 4096, 'geom') FROM (\n    SELECT\n      ST_AsMVTGeom(ST_Transform(ST_CurveToLine(geom), 3857), ST_TileEnvelope(z, x, y), 4096, 64, true) AS geom\n    FROM table_source\n    WHERE geom && ST_Transform(ST_TileEnvelope(z, x, y), 4326)\n  ) as tile WHERE geom IS NOT NULL;\n\n  RETURN mvt;\nEND\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE;","metadata":{"source":"https://github.com/maplibre/martin","name":"martin","fullName":"maplibre/martin","authorUrl":"https://github.com/maplibre","author":"maplibre","title":"maplibre/martin; Blazing fast and lightweight PostGIS, MBtiles and PMtiles tile server","licence":"","loc":{"lines":{"from":366,"to":380}}}}],["728",{"pageContent":"The `query_params` argument is a JSON representation of the tile request query params.

GeoPandas\nobjects can act on [shapely](http://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\ngeometry objects and perform geometric operations.\n\nGeoPandas geometry operations are cartesian.  The coordinate reference\nsystem (crs) can be stored as an attribute on an object, and is\nautomatically set when loading from a file.
