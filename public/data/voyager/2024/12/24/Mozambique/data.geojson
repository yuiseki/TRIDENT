        "description": "As vast parts of southern Africa grapple with an unprecedented mid-season dry spell, the food security situation in Mozambique continues to deteriorate. The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. ([IFRC, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065342))\n\nAround 20 million people reside in areas that have now been hit by drought, 2.7 million of whom were already struggling with food insecurity (IPC3+) before the onset of El Niño. DG ECHO contributed EUR 200,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Emergency Appeal, aiming to support the Mozambique Red Cross in its response to the drought and food insecurity in the country. ([ECHO, 30 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4066379/))\n\nIn view of the unfolding disasters regionally, SADC Council directed the SADC Secretariat to develop a regional appeal to facilitate coordinated response to the various disaster affecting the region. ([SADC, 5 June 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4067778/))\n\nCrisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand\nbetween October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.

However, several basins around the at-risk areas might reach alert levels.\nPemba City is at risk of urban floods, specifically the following areas: Bairro Cariaco, Alto Chuiba, Eduardo Mondlane, Natite, Ingonane, Paquetequete, Carioca.\n\nThere are concerns that due to cyclone Chido, the ongoing cholera outbreak in Nampula (283 cases and 21 deaths reported, as of 11 December) might deteriorate further.
