        "description": "Heavy rainfall across Afghanistan on 29 and 30 March has destroyed more than 1,500 acres of agricultural land and resulted in severe damage to over 540 homes, as well as other critical infrastructure across seven provinces, including six bridges and 450 km of road. Based on initial reports and assessments, the provinces where most damage has been reported are Faryab province in the Northern region, Nangarhar province in the Eastern region, and Daikundi province in the Central Highlands region.
