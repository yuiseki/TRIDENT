The situation is further complicated by the continuous cross-border risks from endemic countries. Alongside the ongoing concern of cholera, which is endemic in Burundi, other waterborne diseases have also been reported. Since the outbreak was declared by the government, the situation has quickly evolved into a nationwide crisis, with a high risk that additional cases remain undetected. The first cases were reported on July 22, 2024 (as per the Sitrep of July 25). Analyses conducted on three samples at the National  Laboratory confirmed all three as positive for Mpox. By July 29, 2024 (Sitrep July 30, 2024), the number of cases had increased by 50%, with six new cases confirmed. On July 31, 13 positive cases were reported in the health districts of Bujumbura Nord (6), DS Kayanza (2), Bujumbura Centre (2), Gahombo (1), Rutovu (1), and Ruyigi (1). The Sitrep of August 8, 2024, reported 68 suspected cases, with 46% being men and 54% women. Among the 68 confirmed cases, 411 contacts were identified for tracing, which extended to areas beyond the initial districts, requiring community follow-up. As of August 12, 2024, the Ministry of Health reported 77 cases. The outbreak has spread rapidly both geographically and in terms of caseload.
