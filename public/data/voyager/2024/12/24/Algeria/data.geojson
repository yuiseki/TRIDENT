        "description": "On September 8, 2024, a severe tropical disturbance triggered widespread flooding across several provinces in southern and western Algeria. The most affected areas include Béchar, Elbayadh, Beni Abbes, Tamanrasset, Tiaret, Tindouf, and Naama. The flooding, which began around September 5th, intensified by September 8th, displacing approximately 2,220 families, some of them from nomadic communities. In Béchar, the number of displaced families surged to 2,060, which were forced to evacuate. Roads and critical infrastructure, including 4 bridges, water, and electricity systems, were severely damaged in Béchar. Rescue operations have been carried out to save and evacuate individuals trapped by rising floodwaters. In Elbayadh, 60 families have been affected, and 34 houses were damaged as floods swept through remote areas. In Beni Abbes, rising water levels cut off major roads, and there is a high risk of house damage from the overflow of the rivers at the opening of the Bechar dam. Meanwhile, in Tamanrasset, 100 families from Nomads have been affected, with search and rescue operations ongoing for missing persons following heavy flooding. Tragically, the floods have claimed five lives, including four persons in Bechar and one person in Naama. ([IFRC, 22 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4095847))",

        "description": "The violent conflict in northern Mali, coupled with environmental factors and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, has led to a severe public health emergency in Algeria's southern regions. The mass displacement of thousands of civilians into Algeria has overwhelmed local resources, causing a rapid spread of malaria and diphtheria, exacerbated by heavy rains and low vaccination rates among displaced populations. With hundreds of cases and numerous fatalities, the Algerian Ministry of Health has sought urgent intervention from the Algerian Red Crescent to address the escalating crisis ... By late September, 536 cases of malaria had been recorded, with 40 deaths, alongside 115 cases of diphtheria, with 28 fatalities. ([IFRC, 1 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4107377))",
