        "description": "The Gu (April to June) rains intensified with flash floods reported since 19 April. Four people, three boys in Somaliland and a six-year-old girl in Hirshabelle State were reportedly killed; about 100 shelters for displaced people destroyed and at least 134 families (804 people) affected or displaced across Somalia. ([OCHA, 22 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4056724))\n\nHeavy rains  led to localized floodings which affected an estimated 124,155 people across Somalia as of 28 April, with more than 5,130 displaced and seven children killed, according to partners in the field. The children included three in Somaliland and four in Hirshabelle State. The worst affected were Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West states. On 27 April, flash floods inundated roads connecting Dhobley and Afmadow districts and its environs in Jubaland State, temporarily making the roads impassable thereby affecting an estimated 60,000 people in the two districts. The local airstrips in Dhobley and Afmadow were flooded. Moderate rains were also reported in Middle Juba and Gedo region, notably in Doolow, Luuq, and Bualle. ([OCHA, 28 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4058315))\n\nMore than 163,000 people were affected by heavy rains and floods as of 5 May. At least 37, 120 had been displaced or relocated and seven children killed in 11 out of 22 hotspot districts. At least 67 of the 95 verified settlements for internally displaced people in Hirshabelle were impacted by the rains, affecting about 39,120 people (6, 520 households). Partners reached over 72,000 people with some form of assistance in 25 districts across the country. Those reached include 9,070 households that received unconditional cash assistance. ([OCHA, 6 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4060151/))\n\nThe Gu (April to June) heavy rains and flash floods spread to more areas of Somalia and affected at least 203,438 people, including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed as of 8 May, according to authorities. Humanitarian partners working with the Federal Government had so far reached over 72,000 people in 25 districts with some form of assistance across the country. The floods destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells were submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, posed a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land were inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability. According to humanitarian partners, at least 770,000 people could be affected by the time the Gu season ends.  ([OCHA, 10 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4061419/))\n\nHumanitarian partners, working together with the Federal Government of Somalia, continued to support people affected by Gu (April to June) seasonal rains and flash floods, and reached at least 157,000 people with some form of assistance. As of 14 May, the number of people affected by the ongoing rains had risen to 225,759 people including 38,727 people displaced and 9 deaths, according to the authorities. At least 3,000 people had been relocated. Across Somalia, the heavy rains and flash floods have resulted in the loss of livelihoods, including livestock, cropland, damaged small businesses and destroyed infrastructure including shelter (3,367 destroyed and 870 affected), water sources (29 water points), latrines (5,002), schools (7), and damaged roads. ([OCHA, 19 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4063422/))\n\nHumanitarian agencies, the Federal Government of Somalia, Federal Member States and partners continued to provide lifesaving assistance and reached at least 201,000 people in 36 districts with unconditional cash transfers, food and non- food items, cholera prevention and awareness messages, health, protection and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) assistance. The rains affected some 268,359 people and killed 10. The number of people displaced significantly rose to 81,000 from 38,700 reported on 19 May after the Shabelle River broke its banks in Belet Weyne district, displacing 42,600 people in Koshin, Haawo taako, Buundoweye, and Howlwadaag areas. At least 9,000 of those displaced in Belet Weyne reportedly returned to their homes and another 30,000 people were expected to return in the next two weeks. Schools in Belet Weyne town re-opened. In Dhobley and Afmadow, Jubaland State, some 24,000 people who were displaced went  back to their homes due to prevailing dry conditions.  Meanwhile, the spill over of Tropical Storm Laly reportedly led to the drowning of eight children in Marka town, Lower Shabelle on 23 May, according to the local community. Cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera have risen across the country. In addition, the rains have impacted heavily on the water, sanitation and hygiene sector, destroying 644 latrines and extensively damaging 124 water points, thereby increasing vulnerability to waterborne diseases.
