The outbreak has affected 63 people and caused 12 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 19%. ([UNICEF, 3 November 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4011661))\n\nIn Fangak county, Jonglei State, a Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) outbreak was declared in September 2023, with 118 cumulative cases recorded, including 6 deaths. UNICEF State Health, WASH, and SBC teams, in October 2023, mobilized a response with implementing partners and local authorities to contain the outbreak.  ([UNICEF, 7 December 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4021069))\n\nIn response to a deadly Hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a mass vaccination campaign in collaboration with the Ministry of Health to safeguard women and girls of reproductive age, who are at greatest risk of death from the disease. Since April 2023, 501 cases of Hepatitis E have been treated at the MSF hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, and 21 people have died—mainly women. The fatality can be as high as 40 percent for pregnant women, and there is no cure, meaning that many people with advanced stages of illness do not survive. MSF's vaccination campaign is the first to be conducted during the acute stages of an active Hepatitis E outbreak anywhere in the world. It is made more challenging by the remoteness and isolation of the area of South Sudan where it is taking place. But if the campaign succeeds, it will save lives.

This alarming declaration came after 2 individuals exhibited symptoms consistent with hepatitis E and one positive case was confirmed in Juba after laboratory tests. PH prevention measures are underway.

        "description": "Humanitarian partners expect floods in the second half of 2024, with a peak from September to December. This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses. ([IFRC, 1 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4083163))\n\nContinuous heavy rains since May, combined with controlled water releases from Lake Victoria, have significantly raised Nile River levels, affecting up to 472,000 people across 26 of South Sudan's 78 counties and Abyei Administrative Area. The floods have devastated homes, destroyed crops, disrupted education and health services, and restricted access to essential facilities. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091161))\n\nAs of 12 September, flooding has affected over 735,000 people across 38 of South Sudan’s 78 counties and the Abyei Administrative Area. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 65,000 people have been displaced, with over 41,000 in Warrap State alone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to aid 700,000 flood-affected people in five severely impacted counties. The South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated $5 million to complement this effort. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093561))\n\nFlooding has affected over 890,000 people across the country. The latest increase is attributed to newly confirmed numbers of affected people in the Abyei Administrative Area, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states. About 226,000 people are flood-displaced, including 114,480 reported from Unity State alone. Due to damaged and impassable roads, physical access to affected communities remains a challenge. On 3 October, the Council of Ministers endorsed the declaration of a state of emergency in flood-affected states. ([OCHA, 4 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099213))",

This declaration comes after reports of 44 suspected cholera cases, and six laboratory-confirmed cases on 23 October 2024 in Renk, Upper Nile State. As of 27 October 2024, 49 cholera cases have been reported among refugees, returnees, and local communities. The first suspected case was reported on 28 September 2024 after the County Health Department received a report of a suspected case of cholera at the point of entry in Renk, a border town between Sudan and South Sudan. In response, the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, and other partners are taking steps to manage the outbreak. In a press conference in Juba, Health Minister Honorable Yolanda Awel Deng assured citizens that the government is committed to stopping the spread of cholera in Renk, Upper Nile State. “The Ministry of Health is aware of the difficult conditions refugees and returnees face, such as overcrowding and poor water and sanitation, which can lead to outbreaks; however, the Ministry is working with health and water sanitation and hygiene cluster partners on the ground to ensure that the risk of the outbreak spreading is minimized,” said Hon. Deng. She also added that the Ministry of Health and WHO have taken steps to proper management of cases reported, ensuring that every-contact on the ground is followed. She urged the communities to practice good and safe behaviors, such as consistent hand washing, use of latrines, and proper food handling throughout the outbreak season.

The death of two children has also been reported in Renk, both having similar profile, undernourished under five years old children. The Health response is extending through surge response teams to increase detection and treatment, distribution of cholera kits and WHO request for vaccination (OCV). In parallel, the WASH actors are also mobilising their means for chlorination, disinfection and sensitisation of the population. ([ECHO, 6 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108316))",
