        "description": "On 16 September 2022, the Ethiopia Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak in the Harana Buluk and Berbere woredas of Bale Zone, Oromia Region. On 25 September 2022, a total of 16 new cholera cases (14 severe) were reported. There were no new deaths. While 2 patients were discharged, Cholera Treatment Centers (CTC) reported 14 new admissions. Anecdotally, the outbreak is also reported to have expanded to the Dolo Mena woreda, which constitutes a risk of further spread. Cholera outbreak response activities are ongoing in both woredas. ([IFRC, 4 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3892856/)) \n\nAs of 10 October, 191 cholera cases were reported in 3 woredas of Bale zone (Harana Buluk, Berbere and Delo Mena) with 4 associated deaths (Cumulative Case Fatality Rate – CFR - of 2.09 per cent1). The use of unsafe water from contaminated water points is the most likely cause of this outbreak. Limited access to water and sanitation (WASH) services, poor hygiene practices, including open defecation and lack of water treatment options are among the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease across these three woredas. New suspected cases are reported daily in the three affected woredas. As of the reporting date, there are 15 active cases (3 cases in Delo Mena, 10 in Berbere and 2 in Harana Buluk woredas) in the existing Cholera Treatment Center (CTC), with 71 per cent of the patients experiencing severe dehydration symptoms. Due to people’s mobility, there is a high risk that the outbreak could propagate into bordering zones of Southern and Eastern Oromia, SNNP and Somali regions. ([OCHA, 13 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895925/))\n\nMeanwhile, new cases of cholera continue to be reported in affected areas in Bale Zone of Oromia Region. As of 10 October, and since 27 August, 196 cases were reported in Berbere, Delo Mena and Herena Buluk woredas, including in Burka IDP site. The cholera outbreak has already spread to neighboring Somali Region with 18 cases recently reported in Karsadula Woreda of Liban Zone. In SNNP Region, laboratory test of ten suspected cholera cases from Amaro Special Woreda returned a negative result. ([OCHA, 17 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3897151))\n\nAs of 25 October 2022, 273 cholera cases have been reported including 9 deaths. Suspected cases in East Bale are under investigation. Reportedly, 114 additional woredas are at risk of an outbreak. The caseload has increased by 30 per cent since October 10, with new daily cases reported in Berbere and Kersadula woredas. According to EPHI, close to 459,000 people are at high risk in the four woredas, especially IDPs living in sites. The response is hindered by insufficient funding and partners’ presence. Shortage of WASH treatment chemicals, limited amount of water storage items (reservoir tanks, jerry cans, etc.), insufficient water trucking capacity and large number of non-functional water schemes represent the major gaps.

At least 15 of these cases have been laboratory-confirmed through culture. The cumulative attack rate is 89.6 per 100 000 population. Seventeen deaths have been reported, for a CFR of 4.3%.

The caseload of affected people has increased by 28 per cent in the last two weeks with new daily cases reported in Berbere, Gura Damole, Quarsadula woredas. In Guradamole woreda of Liban zone, cases are expanding at high pace, especially across IDP spontaneous sites where more than 60 per cent of the new affected caseloads are recorded.

There is ongoing outbreak in 58 woredas in Oromia (30), Somali (3), SNNP (21) and Sidama (4) since 27 August 2022.

The case fatality rate (CFR) is at 1.38, while the standard indicator for adequate case management is a CFR less than 1 per cent. Eighty-one cholera treatment centres have been established and oral vaccinations have been provided across affected regions, however challenges remain around the administration of single dose vaccinations due to shortage in global supply. Current clean water supply coverage in cholera affected woredas in Oromia and Somali regions is also low, further exasperating the spread. Separate from the cholera affected regions, close to 18,000 people in Debre Birhan benefited from health education as preventative measures following a confirmed isolated cholera case in the city on 19 June.
