([OCHA, 18 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094830/))\n\nSince 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi have led to severe flooding across **Myanmar**. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state’s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan.

Likewise, the floods and landslides caused the destruction of more than 141,000 buildings, including homes, schools, offices, and critical infrastructure, such as 533 roads and bridges. Furthermore, several concurrent low-pressure systems around Bay of Bengal resulted in persistent rains, leading to additional flooding. In the beginning of October, recurrent flooding impacted Mandalay region, Eastern and Southern Shan states, disrupting needs analysis, relief deliveries, and humanitarian assistance efforts, while compounding the needs of the vulnerable population affected by multiple hazards. Local markets, health facilities, and homes were devastated, significantly reducing access to food, water, and medical supplies.

([OCHA, 24 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4104252/))\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by Typhoon Yagi—one of the most powerful storms to hit Southeast Asia in decades – heavy rains have continued to batter many of the hardest-hit areas. Needs assessments reveal that over 5.6 million people, including at least 1.6 million children, were directly affected by the resulting floods and landslides across Viet Nam, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Thailand. The disaster has severely disrupted access to clean water, essential social services, education, healthcare, food, and shelter, leaving millions in urgent need of assistance. ([UNICEF, 6 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4116100/))\n\n[In **Vietnam**], three months after the typhoon children and families in affected areas still face acute deprivations and risks. Health and water systems remain damaged, denying 570,000 people access to safe drinking water and clean sanitation, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks and interruptions to routine immunization. About 220,000 children under five and 70,000 pregnant and lactating women remain at risk of malnutrition due to disrupted health and other services, food shortages and lack of clean water. Over 830,000 children in the worst-affected areas experienced a loss of 60-120 hours of learning and are being impacted by the damage to school infrastructure and learning materials. Disruptions of education in typhoon-affected regions, which already have lower learning outcomes, are increasing existing disparities, especially among ethnic minority children.
