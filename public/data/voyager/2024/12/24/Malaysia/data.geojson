        "description": "At the end of November 2024, Malaysia experienced heavy rainfall attributed to the Northeast Monsoon, resulting in escalating flooding across nine states: Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Perak, Melaka and Perlis. The heavy rain caused significant damage to livelihood, houses and livestock, severely impacting the affected communities.\n\nAs of 2 December 2024, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) reported that approximately 137,410 people have been affected by the ongoing floods across multiple areas in Malaysia. The Deputy Prime Minister, informed the media that this year's flooding is the worst since 2014, with Kelantan and Terengganu being particularly badly affected. Since 27 November, a total of 633 temporary shelter centers have been opened to accommodate 40,922 families displaced by the floods. The disaster has claimed five lives in Kelantan and Terengganu, as confirmed by the Department of Social Welfare (JKM).\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security reported that Malaysia has suffered approximately about CHF 1.79 million in losses due to the destruction of rice/paddy plantation caused by the flood. The significant damage has forced the country to increase reliance on imported rice to meet domestic needs. Overall, the Malaysian agriculture sector faces a total estimated loss of CHF 3.77 million due to the disaster. [...]\n\nThe Malaysian Meteorological Department (MET Malaysia) has forecasted continued adverse weather conditions, including thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds, across Peninsular Malaysia between 6 to 9 December 2024. These conditions are expected to exacerbate the ongoing flooding, increasing the number of affected individuals and intensifying challenges for emergency response and recovery efforts. Persistent heavy rainfall has already caused river water levels to surpass designated danger thresholds, posing a severe risk of river overflows that could inundate surrounding areas.\n\nThis relentless rainfall has caused extensive damage, not only to homes but also to critical infrastructure. Roads, airports, and railways, particularly in the East Coast states, have been severely affected, cutting off intercity connections and complicating relief efforts. The combined impact of floods and landslides underscores the urgent need for enhanced mitigation measures and coordinated response strategies. ([IFRC, 08 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4116679/))\n\nPeninsular Malaysia, including Johor, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, and Terengganu States continues to experience heavy rainfall and consequent floods that resulted in displacements and damage. According to the ASEAN Disaster Information Network (ADINet), in the past few days, 6,517 people have been displaced in 44 evacuation centres across the aforementioned states.
