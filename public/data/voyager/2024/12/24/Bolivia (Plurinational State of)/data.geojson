        "description": "On 24 July 2024, the Bolivia Ministry of Defense (MINDEF per its acronym in Spanish) published information on wildfires occurring in Bolivia. MINDEF is reporting 11,576 hotspots distributed throughout the national territory (6,671 increase since the 17 July report), of which, almost 96% are in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni. Additionally, 20 wildfires were contained (6 increase). A total of 46,197 families in 149 municipalities were attended to by MINDEF. ([PAHO, 25 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4081309))\n\nIn Bolivia, wildfires have devastated the eastern region, particularly affecting Chiquitano villages in Santa Cruz. Since early July, these fires have ravaged over 900,000 hectares, an area comparable to the entire state of New Jersey. Local communities, including Tuná and Cañón Verde, are struggling as the fires continue to threaten their homes and livelihoods. ([OCHA, 9 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4085232))\n\nAccording to data from the Heat Foci Monitoring System (SIMB), as of 10 September, more than 46,536 heat spots were registered, with 80% concentrated in Santa Cruz. [...] The severity of the situation led the government to declare a state of national emergency on 8 September (Supreme Decree No. 5219), due to the impact on the environment, public health, biodiversity, and the productive activities of the population. At least 54 municipalities were affected, of which 23 declared a state of disaster and 5 a state of emergency. [...] As of 16 September, 25,335 people (5,067 families) were officially reported by the Vice minister of Civil Defense as affected and according to the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) at least 124,000 exposed, although it is estimated that these figures could be higher due to difficulties in collecting data in remote areas. At least 60 homes were affected, and two deaths were reported. ([IFRC, 23 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4096190))",
