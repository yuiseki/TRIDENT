        "description": "The situation in the Dominican Republic remains critical as heavy rains continue to saturate soils after several days of persistent rainfall. According to meteorological forecasts, the country is under the influence of two cold fronts and two troughs that will affect the weather during the next days, which will generate a significant rainy period in a large part of the country. Furthermore, the recent opening of dam floodgates has increased river and stream flows, raising the risk of overflows and potential flooding in both urban and rural areas. With additional rainfall expected in the coming days, soil saturation is likely to intensify. The heavy rainfall will increase the risk of flash floods, as well as flooding of rivers and ravines, especially in the north, northeast, Central Cordillera, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country. Authorities are closely monitoring conditions and adjusting alerts to respond to this high-risk scenario. ([IFRC, 19 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4111805))",
