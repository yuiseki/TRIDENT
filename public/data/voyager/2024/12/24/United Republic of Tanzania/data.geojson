        "description": "The Ministry of Health in the United Republic of Tanzania notified the World Health Organization about a cholera outbreak in three regions, namely Arusha, Kigoma, and Mara, in July 2023. On 11 September 2023, Mara region recorded 13 suspected cases, which were subsequently laboratory-confirmed at the Tanzania National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), followed by five confirmed cholera cases which were reported in Kigoma region on 13 September 2023. During epidemiological week 40 (ending 8 October 2023), 16 new cases were reported, including 14 in Arusha, and two in Mara region with no reported deaths. As of 8 October 2023, a total of 268 cholera cases with nine deaths (CFR= 3.3%) have been reported and Most of the cases (61.0%, n=164) were recorded in the Mara region, followed by Arusha (24.0%, n=66) and Kigoma (14.0%, n=38). ([WHO, 20 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4008024))\n\nOn 3 October 2023, WHO was notified about a Cholera outbreak affecting three regions of Tanzania Mainland: Mara, bordering Kenya, Arusha and Kigoma. As of 28 October 2023, a total of 548 cases including 14 deaths (CFR 2.6%) were reported from eleven districts of Mara, Kigoma, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Singida regions. Four cases were admitted in Singida (3) and Arusha (1). Of the 72 samples tested by culture, 53 showed growth of Vibrio cholerae. Women account for 55.5% (304) of cases, and 44.7% (245) of cases are aged between 15 and 44 years. [WHO, 9 Nov 2023.](https://reliefweb.int/node/4013225)\n\nSince September 5th, 2023, a cholera outbreak has been reported in 13 regions of Tanzania Mainland, including Mara, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Kigoma, Kagera, Singida, Simiyu, Shinyanga, Tabora, Ruvuma, Dodoma, Mwanza, and Geita. A total of 1,521 cases and 34 deaths (a Case Fatality Rate of 2.3%) have been recorded. Out of these regions, the cholera outbreak has been declared over in five: Mara, Kigoma, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Dodoma. However, cases in Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu, and Kagera regions have continued to rise, making them the most affected currently. The increasing trend indicates a risk of further spread without necessary interventions. With the upcoming El Niño and the long rains expected from March to May 2024, there is a likelihood of a rise in cases, potentially affecting more regions. This situation is exacerbated by the current outbreaks in eight regions (Kagera, Ruvuma, Simiyu, Tabora, Shinyanga, Singida, Geita, and Mwanza) with 851 active cases reported since December 23rd, 2023. Most cases (46.8%) are female, with the majority (33.8%) aged between 15 and 49 years.
