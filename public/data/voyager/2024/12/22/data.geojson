Suspected cholera cases have also been registered in Khartoum and South Kordofan states but the limited access and inability to send samples to laboratories prevent the authorities from confirming the outbreak in these states. ([ECHO, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001374))\n\nHealth partners report that between 15 April and 15 September, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) identified over 4,000 measles cases and 107 associated deaths, most from White Nile and Aj Jazirah states. ([OCHA, 28 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001385/))\n\nSudan has declared a cholera outbreak in Gedaref State, where 264 suspected cholera cases, 4 confirmed cases and 16 associated deaths had been reported by 25 September 2023. Investigations are ongoing to determine whether cholera has also spread to Khartoum and South Kordofan states, where increased cases of acute watery diarrhoea have been reported. ([WHO, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001401))\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1,457 suspected cholera cases and 64 associated deaths have been reported from four states as of 17 October 2023. The outbreak comes at a time that Sudan’s health care system is stretched to the limit: about 70 per cent of hospitals in conflict-affected states are non-functional and facilities in non-conflictaffected states are overwhelmed by the influx of displaced people. ([OCHA, 17 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4007441))\n\nAs of 22 October, there were 1,618 suspected cases of cholera, including 67 associated deaths, in 22 localities of four states, according to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH).

Most of the suspected cases tested positive with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and the causative organism (V. cholerae) has been isolated from 33 cases in four states. There are 1,243 suspected cases of cholera, including 22 laboratory confirmed cases and 36 associated deaths, in Gedaref; 501 suspected cases, including 7 laboratory confirmed cases and 10 associated deaths, in Aj Jazirah; 403 suspected cases, including 1 laboratory confirmed case and 24 associated deaths, in Khartoum; 346 suspected cases and eight associated deaths in South Kordofan; 23 suspected cases, including 3 laboratory confirmed cases, in Kassala; and nine suspected cases in Sennar. Based on the epidemiological situation in the affected states, a risk assessment was conducted to identify high-risk localities and target groups for vaccination against cholera. More than 3.1 million people are estimated to be at risk of AWD and cholera in eight states in 13 localities between July and December 2023 as per cholera hotspot mapping exercise conducted by the FMoH with technical support of WHO.

As of 9 November, at least 2,525 suspected cases, including 78 associated deaths, have been reported in seven states. Over 3.1 million people are estimated to be at risk of acute watery diarrhoea and cholera. Following the declaration of the outbreak, WHO, UNICEF and partners activated an Inter-agency Multi-cluster Cholera Action Plan. The International Coordination Group on Vaccine Provision approved the Federal Ministry of Health’s request for more than 2.9 million doses of oral cholera vaccines for reactive vaccination campaigns. Vaccines are expected to arrive on 20 November, and vaccination is expected to start by the end of November. DG ECHO partners are responding to the outbreak and scaling up their operations by supporting the detection and treatment of cases. Surveillance is ongoing in affected and high-risk areas to identify and address risk factors.

A total of 323 deaths had been reported from 11 states, for a CFR of 2.8%. The previous outbreak had unofficially ended before the present one began (more than two incubation periods without a case). [Health Cluster, WHO, 1 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091551)\n\nAs of 19 November, WHO reported more than a thousand deaths and a total of 37,514 cholera cases in the country. The case fatality rate is 2.7%. The escalation of the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has limited the population's access to health services due to its impact on staff, medical supplies and fuel in health centres. 70-80% of health facilities in areas worst affected by the conflict are not functioning. In response to the increased cholera cases, DG ECHO funded humanitarian partners to preposition supplies and scale up their WASH and health responses, repair water supply lines, distribute hygiene kits, launch cholera sensitization and hygiene promotion campaigns, dispatch emergency medical teams and set up cholera treatment centres.

The rising waters of Lake Tanganyika have impacted 10 communes across 4 provinces, affecting all households in the vicinity. Currently, 162,356 people are at high risk, while 66,391 individuals are already in need of assistance. Comparing the current rise in water levels to those of 2021, observations suggest an increase of approximately 100cm. The Ministry of Environment and Agriculture has advised residents in affected areas to relocate to safer, non-flooded zones.([IFRC, 1 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4055452))\n### Appeals & Response Plans\n\n- [![OCHA: Burundi: Plan de réponse inondations et montée du lac Tanganyika (effets El-Niño) - Cover preview](https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/small/public/previews/cb/c1/cbc19321-5260-4d34-9ac9-eb4856d6d3f0.png) OCHA: Burundi: Plan de réponse inondations et montée du lac Tanganyika (effets El-Niño)](https://reliefweb.int/node/4060921)",

        "description": "Mongolia is currently facing a severe Dzud. This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. ([UNICEF, 25 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4032456))\n\nAs a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. ([IFRC, 2 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4035085/))\n\nThe current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia's rural communities and traditional livelihoods. ([UN RC Mongolia, 6 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4036374/))\n\nAccording to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years’ data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. ([UNICEF, 21 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4039973/))\n\nAs of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. ([ECHO, 23 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4040820/))\n\n[...] The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock – nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold – Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. ([OCHA, 5 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4043598/))\n\n[...]  According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). ([IFRC, 15 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4046890/))\n\nBetween November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. ([UNICEF, 22 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4048939))\n\nThe situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. ([OCHA, 26 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4049776))\n\nHealth concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. [...] The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. [...] The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. ([IFRC, 4 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4052404))\n\nBetween November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. ([UNICEF, 1 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4059029))\n\nAlthough the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children.  Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. ([UNICEF, 4 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4068169/))\n\nOfficial estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food. ([FAO, 10 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076926))\n\nIn addition to the Dzud impacts, the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) addressed the high risk of “yellow” floods due to accumulated snowfall and  livestock carcasses in Dzud-affected regions by the end of May 2024. However, NAMEM issued warning for potential floods during summertime from high precipitation levels forecasted. From June to August 2024, heavy rains and floods affected several Dzud-affected regions including Uvurkhangai, Tuv, Zavkhan, and Umnugobi, directly and indirectly impacting over 1,300 people and leading to the loss of 22,000 livestock. Furthermore, a series of wildfire struck the region most affected by the dzud including Khentii, Dornod, Sukhbaatar provinces between 11-16 October, directly affecting 21 families,  resulting in the loss of two children and 1,000 livestock, and burning 16 hectares of pastureland. These recurring hazards continue to compound the difficulties faced by Dzud-affected herder communities. As of 25 October, NAMEM has issued seasonal weather forecasts for October 2024 to January 2025 and MoFALI has updated pasture carrying capacity estimates and September update on the winter preparation for 2024/2025. According to NAMEM forecast, the temperatures may fluctuate between October, November, December 2024, and January 2025, with warmer conditions anticipated for October and November but colder-than-average temperatures predicted for December 2024 and January 2025, raising concerns for a possible ice/iron Dzud situation.

The fatality can be as high as 40 percent for pregnant women, and there is no cure, meaning that many people with advanced stages of illness do not survive. MSF's vaccination campaign is the first to be conducted during the acute stages of an active Hepatitis E outbreak anywhere in the world. It is made more challenging by the remoteness and isolation of the area of South Sudan where it is taking place. But if the campaign succeeds, it will save lives.

        "description": "About nine million people in Malawi are reeling from the devastating impacts of El Niño-induced floods and drought, which are destroying harvests and causing hunger to soar to crisis levels ... An El Niño-induced drought has severely affected this season’s maize harvest, resulting in a forecast 45 percent decline against the five-year average and exacerbating food insecurity, and about 40 percent of the population could be facing acute hunger by the end of year because of the drought. In addition, about 14,000 people were displaced by floods and landslides in the northern part of the country. On 25 March, the President of Malawi declared a national disaster. The National Response Plan launched in April estimates the needs at US$449 million. Similarly, neighbouring countries of Zambia and Zimbabwe have also declared national drought emergencies. ([CCC, FAO, Gov't of Malawi, OCHA, WFP 13 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4061924))\n\nApproximately 4.2 million people (20 percent of the analysed population) are expected to experience high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in Malawi in the current period (June and September 2024), including 56,000 people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 4.1 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These populations require urgent humanitarian action to reduce their food consumption gaps, protect and restore their livelihoods and prevent high levels of acute malnutrition. An additional 6.7 million people are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) between the same period and require interventions to mitigate disaster risks and safeguard their livelihoods. Most of the population in Phase 3 or above are not able to produce enough of their own food and are dependent on market purchases for their food needs. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate during the projection period from October 2024 to March 2025 which coincides with the lean season in Malawi. The resulting impact of El Niño on crop production will exacerbate the situation further and is likely to result in an earlier onset of the lean season. In this projected period, 5.7 million people (28 percent of the analysed population are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above). These people will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, particularly for the 416,000 people in Phase 4, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition.

A total of 18,323 people were affected, including thousands of displaced families, with 1,129 houses and several crop lands and infrastructures completely destroyed. The rains intensified in the first half of May, causing water levels to rise and rivers such as Manafwa, Lwakhakha, Sironko, Mpologoma, Awoja, Nbuyonga, and Namatala to overflow, increasing the water flow from the slopes of Mount Elgon. Unprecedented flooding occurred, especially between May 7th and 11th, exacerbating the impacts experienced throughout April.

The continuous crop failures over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hands, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity. Approximately, 325,000 individuals are experiencing the ramifications of the ongoing food insecurity based on IPC information, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately 22% of the population. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas. In these districts, access to adequate food and nutrition is severely compromised, necessitating urgent intervention and support measures to alleviate the hardship faced by affected communities. ([IFRC, 17 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4063043))\n\nA below-normal harvest and increased market reliance have resulted in maize prices rising during the main harvest. Although a larger area was planted in the 2023/24 than the previous season, dry conditions damaged much of the crop between January and March, especially maize. Some poor and very poor households that experienced significant crop losses are already relying on food purchases from local markets, which is earlier than normal. Retail staple food prices are expected to increase further due to below-average local production and higher prices for imported maize. Consequently, household purchasing capacity is expected to decline, particularly between August and September, when market purchases are the main food source, and labor opportunities are often seasonally limited. Overall, most households are likely to continue to meet their food needs through September, driving area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes.

The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces.

In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand\nbetween October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.

        "description": "On 22 May, the Government of Namibia declared the State of Emergency following the worst drought that the country has experienced in 100 years. According to media reports, every one in five Namibians is considered food insecure. Against the backdrop of scarce rains, over 331,000 households have already registered for the government-funded drought relief programme to assist the affected communities. This programme amounts to EUR 40 million but it currently has a funding gap of EUR 25 million. At the extraordinary summit held on 20 May by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to discuss the El Niño-induced drought and floods affecting member states, the Namibian President called for assistance from SADC countries and the International Community at large to bridge the above-mentioned funding gap. ([ECHO, 29 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065957))\n\nBetween April and June 2024, an estimated 1.2 million people (40 percent of the analysed population) in Namibia face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods. These are the most vulnerable groups (unemployed, marginalized communities, those with no national documents to benefit from social safety nets, children under the age of five, pregnant and breastfeeding women and pensioners) in both urban and rural areas. This number has more than doubled from 491,000 people (19 percent of the population analysed) which were projected to be facing acute food insecurity during the period under review in the July 2023 analysis.The entire country (all 14 regions) is classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and need action for livelihood protection. Namibia’s deteriorating food security is mainly driven by the impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, climatic shocks, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. ([IPC, 8 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076162))\n\nDuring the current period of analysis, from July to September 2024, 1.15 million people in Namibia (38 percent of the analysed population) face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods; all the 14 areas of analysis are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). This represents an improvement compared to what was projected in the last July 2023 analysis, where 1.44 million people (48 percent) were expected to face high levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) for the same period (July-September 2024). While the main assumption on the impact of El Nino was adjusted, the deterioration of the food security situation is still linked to the negative impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. In the first projection period (October 2024 – March 2025), the food security situation is expected to worsen due to the start of the lean season, and seasonal price increases, where 1.26 million people (41 percent of the analysed population) are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above.

Since the end of June, low-lying areas along various rivers, especially Ayeyarwady and Chindwin, have been affected. In the northwest, more than 15 townships in Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing have been affected, with an estimated 118,000 people being temporarily evacuated to safer places since the beginning of July. Sagaing has been the hardest hit, with at least 11 townships flooded, followed by Mandalay, which had four townships affected. In Kachin, approximately 37,000 people in several townships were also temporarily evacuated due to the flash flooding on 30 June. Most of the flood-affected population in Myitkyina and Waingmaw townships have returned home as water levels have receded. Immediate lifesaving assistance was provided by humanitarian partners and local authorities in Kachin and in the northwest. ([OCHA, 16 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4078287))\n\nIn Myanmar, the monsoon season has brought prolonged heavy rainfall which caused flooding over Kachin, Kayin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady (DDM). According to reports from DDM as of 4 August, approximately 230,000 persons or 56,000 households affected.

This situation is exacerbated by Typhoon Gaemi, which struck Taiwan with wind speeds of 127 mph on 25 July. The residual clouds from the typhoon moved towards Myanmar, Thailand, and China, potentially generating further flooding and heavy rainfall in these regions. ([IFRC, 10 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4085306))\n\nSince the end of June, torrential monsoon rains and overflow of various rivers have submerged several states and regions from the north to the south of the country. Flooding temporarily affected Kachin State in early July and Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing regions across the Northwest around mid-July. Several townships in Rakhine State have been submerged since the last week of July, although the water level has been receding. Since 25 July, there has been widespread flooding in southeastern Myanmar, with multiple townships being inundated in the states and regions of Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Mon and Tanintharyi. Countrywide, it is estimated that the flooding has affected more than 393,000 people, resulting in the temporary displacement of many families, damages to and disruption of roads, railways and the movement of goods, destruction of paddy fields and livelihoods, and closure of schools. ([OCHA, 16 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4086811/))\n\nDG ECHO has replenished the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (IFRC-DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with € 200,000 to support victims of heavy flooding in Myanmar, which has affected more than 100,000 people. The allocation will help the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) scale up ongoing humanitarian assistance for communities in the most affected areas: Ayeyarwady and Bago region (East and West), Kayin and Mon states, Tanintharyi and Yangon regions. The primary focus of this allocation will be essential household items, cash for immediate necessities, first aid and health support including hygiene items and hygiene promotion to prevent waterborne diseases for 15,000 people in urgent need of assistance. This includes families whose houses were damaged or destroyed, single-parent households with children under five, older persons, and people with disabilities.

So far, more than 300 fatalities and nearly 100 injuries have been reported. The most severely affected areas remain in devastation, with widespread destruction to homes, household assets, water sources, and electricity infrastructure. Roads, bridges, communication networks, schools, public service facilities, religious sites, and crops and farmlands have been severely damaged or completely collapsed. ([OCHA, 20 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4095648/))\n\nAs of 26 September, an estimated 1 million people across 70 out of the 330 townships in Myanmar are reportedly affected by the flooding from heavy monsoon rains and remnants of [Typhoon Yagi](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/52147). This widespread flooding has caused significant damage in the Northwest, Southeast, and Rakhine State. More than 360 people have reportedly drowned, with at least 100 more missing due to the severe flooding. The floods have caused widespread devastation, submerging thousands of crops, farmlands, and livestock, leading to substantial losses in the livelihoods of affected communities. ([OCHA, 27 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097485/))\n\nAbout 300,000 children have been directly affected by the floods, with many schools closed, damaged, or being used as temporary shelters, exacerbating the hardships faced by children already enduring the brunt of ongoing conflict. Homes, household assets and critical infrastructure including health facilities, schools, water and sanitation services, major highways and bridges have been significantly damaged. Many families have been forced to evacuate as livelihoods have also been destroyed. Communication challenges continue due to the flooded roads and destroyed electric lines. Although there has been a decrease in floodwaters in some areas, recurring flooding and potential river overflows continue to be a threat due to the ongoing rain and riverine conditions. Across all affected areas, critical needs include access to safe drinking water, hygiene items, medicine, food, shelter, and humanitarian cash assistance.

This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses.

She urged the communities to practice good and safe behaviors, such as consistent hand washing, use of latrines, and proper food handling throughout the outbreak season. ([WHO, 28 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4105249))\n\nEighty-two cumulative cases of cholera have been confirmed in the country as of 5 November. This includes one confirmed case in Juba Gorom IDP camp, of an individual having recently arrived from Sudan, via Renk transit area in Upper Nile state. The death of two children has also been reported in Renk, both having similar profile, undernourished under five years old children. The Health response is extending through surge response teams to increase detection and treatment, distribution of cholera kits and WHO request for vaccination (OCV). In parallel, the WASH actors are also mobilising their means for chlorination, disinfection and sensitisation of the population. ([ECHO, 6 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108316))",

The maximum sustained winds are currently at 95 kilometers per hour, although a significant increase in its strength and large swells is expected as the system approaches the southern waters of Cuba.\n\nFive western provinces and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud remain under cyclone alert, with over 3.8 million people potentially exposed to the impacts of the system.\n\nAt the same time, the central and eastern regions of the country are experiencing the effects of intense rainfall associated with a trough. Both Tropical Storm Rafael and the trough arrive less than three weeks after the eastern part of Cuba, particularly the province of Guantánamo, suffered the impacts of Hurricane Oscar, which resulted in eight fatalities, two people missing, and substantial material damage.\n\nThe trajectory forecasts for the new storm predominantly cover the provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Río, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, but they also predict potential damage in the capital city, which would pose risks to infrastructure and housing. Significant impacts on agriculture, livelihoods, and electrical infrastructure are also anticipated amid a complex energy situation. ([OCHA, 05 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108146/))\n\n48 hours after the impact of Hurricane Rafael in western and central Cuba, preliminary figures show significant damage to homes, electrical infrastructure and basic services, as well as agriculture, in a context of ongoing response to Hurricane Oscar, which affected eastern Cuba three weeks ago. [...] \n\nSo far, no human losses have been reported, and specialized brigades have been deployed from nearby provinces to support the recovery, including the restoration of basic services and cleaning up debris. The greatest damage is concentrated in the province of Artemisa, where the hurricane severely impacted its 11 municipalities. The intense damage includes the demolition of 10 electricity towers. Several communities are cut off or very difficult to access due to falling trees and power lines, as well as flooding and overflowing rivers. ([UNCT Cuba, 08 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4109177/))\n\nApproximately 800,000 people have suffered the damages caused by this powerful hurricane in the most exposed territories of Artemisa, Mayabeque, Havana and Isla de la Juventud. [...] \n\nFollowing Hurricane Rafael, severe damage to the electrical system caused the water supply to be affected in the western provinces. A week after the impact, in the province of Artemisa, only 17% of the inhabitants had recovered the water supply service and in Havana, only 20%. In Mayabeque, the interruption of electricity service and water pumping continued in the municipalities of Batabanó, Quivicán, Melena del Sur and Nueva Paz. [...]\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Rafael has so far left (damage is still quantified), some 25,471 homes with various damages, concentrating its impact in the province of Artemisa with more than 83% of the damage. Severe effects predominate considering the ravages of strong category 3 winds. As a result, some 92,000 victims have been identified. At the same time, around 60,000 people (20,000 families) have been identified with severe problems in accessing electricity; they have had coverage with small photovoltaic systems as an immediate alternative, among others to access water. At the same time, damage to the conventional power grid has affected an additional 305,000 people. [...]\n\nWith Hurricane Rafael, a total of 144 health institutions were damaged in the three affected provinces of the western region. These include 28 hospitals, 43 polyclinics, 123 family doctor's offices and 51 other types of clinics. In Artemisa, significant damage is reported in two hospitals, the José Ramón Martínez Pediatric Hospital in Guanajay and the Ciro Redondo García General Hospital in the municipality of Artemisa.

The heavy rain caused significant damage to livelihood, houses and livestock, severely impacting the affected communities.\n\nAs of 2 December 2024, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) reported that approximately 137,410 people have been affected by the ongoing floods across multiple areas in Malaysia. The Deputy Prime Minister, informed the media that this year's flooding is the worst since 2014, with Kelantan and Terengganu being particularly badly affected. Since 27 November, a total of 633 temporary shelter centers have been opened to accommodate 40,922 families displaced by the floods. The disaster has claimed five lives in Kelantan and Terengganu, as confirmed by the Department of Social Welfare (JKM).\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security reported that Malaysia has suffered approximately about CHF 1.79 million in losses due to the destruction of rice/paddy plantation caused by the flood. The significant damage has forced the country to increase reliance on imported rice to meet domestic needs. Overall, the Malaysian agriculture sector faces a total estimated loss of CHF 3.77 million due to the disaster. [...]\n\nThe Malaysian Meteorological Department (MET Malaysia) has forecasted continued adverse weather conditions, including thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds, across Peninsular Malaysia between 6 to 9 December 2024. These conditions are expected to exacerbate the ongoing flooding, increasing the number of affected individuals and intensifying challenges for emergency response and recovery efforts. Persistent heavy rainfall has already caused river water levels to surpass designated danger thresholds, posing a severe risk of river overflows that could inundate surrounding areas.\n\nThis relentless rainfall has caused extensive damage, not only to homes but also to critical infrastructure. Roads, airports, and railways, particularly in the East Coast states, have been severely affected, cutting off intercity connections and complicating relief efforts.
