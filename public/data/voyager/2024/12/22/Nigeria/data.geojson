        "description": "In the early hours of August 20, 2024, the Kiri Dam in Tudun Tsira, Shelleng LGA, Adamawa State, breached its banks, resulting in severe flooding across the communities of Kwakwambe, Lure, Nbalang, Imburu, and Bare in the Numan Local Government Area. The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock. The immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, non-food items, medical assistance, and access to clean water. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4088593))\n\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting northern Nigeria since 20 August, causing floods that have resulted in casualties and damage.\nAccording to International Rescue Committee (IRC), as of 2 September, at least 170 people died, 205,338 have been displaced, 515,794 have been affected, and 76,667 houses have been damaged across 28 out of 36 states, including Bauchi, Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, and Jigawa states as the most impacted. ([ECHO, 3 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091049))\n\nHeavy rainfall continues to affect north-eastern Nigeria, causing floods and the Alau Dam overflowing, and resulting in casualties and damage.\nOn 10 September, according to media, the overflow of the Alau Dam, approximately 15 km southwest of Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria, flooded Maiduguri. Over 239,000 people have been affected and at least 50,000 people have been displaced across Fori, Galtimari, Gwange and Bulabulin areas. Several structures have been destroyed, including one hospital and one zoo. ([ECHO, 11 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093101))\n\nAccording to media, as of 12 September, the overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River occurred on 10 September, and flooded Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. At least 30 people died, more than 414,000 have been displaced, approximately 1 million people have been affected, and thousands of houses and structures have been destroyed. ([ECHO, 13 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093771))\n\nMore than 414,000 people are affected by floods in Borno State, with some 37 deaths and 58 people injured reported. Access to hospitals and markets and other critical infrastructure remains limited. Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites. Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed. Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government’s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing. ([OCHA, 15 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094062))\n\nThe flood situation across Nigeria has become a major humanitarian crisis, with 31 states and 180 local government areas (LGAs) severely affected. Over 1,083,141 individuals have been impacted by the relentless rains, leading to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. The floods have left 641,598 persons displaced, 285 people dead, and 2,504 injured. Houses, farmlands, and critical infrastructure have been devastated, with 98,242 homes affected. ([OCHA, 17 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094779))\n\nBetween July and September 2024, 29 states across the nation experienced exceptionally high rainfall, compounded by the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Maiduguri area of Borno State, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to widespread flooding, the collapse of bridges, closure of schools, and restricted access to hospitals and markets. The resulting devastation has caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, crops, and shelters, critically disrupting livelihoods and displacing thousands of households. The latest report by UNOCHA confirms that at least one million people have been affected, with 311 lives lost and more than 3,174 injured. A total of 390,000 people have been displaced, forced to flee with only the belongings they could carry, but now finding themselves in deplorable conditions, without sufficient safeguards and exposed to heightened protection risks. Roughly 245,500 people are living in collective shelters or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, with 2,867 communities impacted across 29 states. Over 6,490,307 square metres (649.0307 hectares) of farmland have been destroyed by the floods, foreshadowing severe humanitarian consequences.  ([IFRC, 18 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094998))\n\nFloodwaters have receded in MMC and Jere LGAs two weeks after the 9 September collapse of the Alau Dam in Borno’s Konduga LGA. As a result, and in response to ongoing efforts to reduce and consolidate temporary relocation sites, the number of people displaced by flooding has reduced from about 400,000 people housed in 36 sites at the height of the crisis to 150,000 people in 22 sites, as of 24 September. ([OCHA, 25 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4096848/))\n\nAlmost four weeks after the collapse of the Alau Dam and subsequent flash floods in Borno State, flood waters have receded in the worst-hit Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere local government areas (LGAs) offering some respite to affected people. Many are returning to their homes and to host communities, while those whose homes remain submerged are being relocated to larger, more centralized temporary sites within the State. The reduction and consolidation of temporary relocation sites is ongoing to better manage the situation and to ensure the return of public facilities such as schools to their intended purpose. Several schools in Borno had been repurposed to accommodate flood-affected people.  Humanitarian needs, however, remain critical despite the significant reduction in the number of displaced people living in emergency shelters, from a peak of 400,000 people at the height of flooding to about 50,000 registered individuals as of 4 October, according to the Borno State Government (BSG) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). An additional 700,000 people also sought shelter with relatives during the flood emergency, according to authorities. ([OCHA, 6 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4096848/))\n\nOver 320 people dead, 1.3 million affected by floods in 34 states in Nigeria. National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) leads joint floods assessments across 19 states in Nigeria. Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) recommends prioritized humanitarian action in Edo, Delta, Anambra, and Bayelsa to mitigate flood impact. Alarming rise in malnutrition cases in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states following floods - more than half a million children under five admitted and/or treated for acute malnutrition between May and September 2024.
