        "description": "Tropical cyclone OSCAR continued inland over south-eastern Cuba on 21 October, as a tropical storm, further weakening. On 22 October at 6.00 UTC its centre was located over the North Atlantic Ocean approximately 70 km south-west of the Crooked Island, far southern Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (tropical storm).\nIts passage over south-eastern Cuba caused heavy rainfall and resulted in casualties and damage. Media reports, as 22 October, six fatalities across the San Antonio del Sur community, Guantanamo province. Several municipalities received more than 300 mm of rain, causing heavy flooding, severe damage to infrastructure and the blocking of roads and highways. Over the next 24 hours, heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges are still forecast over south-eastern Cuba and central and southern Bahamas. ([ECHO, 22 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103682))\n\nFollowing Hurricane Oscar, the UN in Cuba launched a Plan of Action, developed with national authorities, to support immediate response and early recovery. This plan, which seeks US$33 million to assist 478,000 people, will address urgent needs over the first six months, with select projects extending up to 18 months for recovery. [...]\n\nApproximately 150,000 people face urgent needs in areas like Baracoa, Maisí, Imías, and San Antonio del Sur, where widespread flooding hampers rescue efforts and access to water, food, and health services. Power outages are disrupting communications and emergency response. The storm damaged over 14,300 homes, many at risk of roof collapse, along with 56 health facilities, 150 schools, and critical water systems. More than 15,000 hectares of crops were lost, affecting food storage and local livelihoods, including salt and coffee production. ([OCHA, 04 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4107734/))\n\nHurricane Oscar has left nearly 60,000 people affected by various damages to their homes: total and partial collapses, as well as the total or partial loss of roofs. Around 90,000 people, including those whose homes were damaged, have lost basic living and subsistence needs such as mattresses, cooking facilities, hygiene, and lack of electricity due to the impact of the floods. The impact of the floods has been greatest in Imías (which is still cut off) and in San Antonio del Sur municipalities. [...]\n\nGuantánamo province was the hardest hit by Hurricane Oscar. Serious damage was reported in the agricultural sector, in more than 4,000 hectares of vegetables, 750 hectares of bananas, and 1,117 tons of beans. In the agroforestry sector, 4,648 ha of coffee, 3,782 ha of cocoa, and 153 ha of coconut were damaged. In the livestock sector, damage was reported to the roofs of facilities related to small livestock, while in the fishing sector, damage occurred to the infrastructure of fishery product processing centers. In the 4 municipalities of San Antonio del Sur, Imías, Maísi and Baracoa, 1,786 hectares of crops were lost, as well as more than 200 hectares of seedbeds that supported 2,000 hectares of sowing, which includes 27 cultivation houses in the Caujerí Valley module, and 32,800 cans of coffee. In the banana sector, it is estimated that almost 50% of the plantations have been damaged, reaching 70 or 80% in Baracoa and Maisí.

        "description": "Tropical Storm Rafael will hit the western part of Cuba, including Havana, like a hurricane around Wednesday, November 6th. The maximum sustained winds are currently at 95 kilometers per hour, although a significant increase in its strength and large swells is expected as the system approaches the southern waters of Cuba.\n\nFive western provinces and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud remain under cyclone alert, with over 3.8 million people potentially exposed to the impacts of the system.\n\nAt the same time, the central and eastern regions of the country are experiencing the effects of intense rainfall associated with a trough. Both Tropical Storm Rafael and the trough arrive less than three weeks after the eastern part of Cuba, particularly the province of Guantánamo, suffered the impacts of Hurricane Oscar, which resulted in eight fatalities, two people missing, and substantial material damage.\n\nThe trajectory forecasts for the new storm predominantly cover the provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Río, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, but they also predict potential damage in the capital city, which would pose risks to infrastructure and housing. Significant impacts on agriculture, livelihoods, and electrical infrastructure are also anticipated amid a complex energy situation. ([OCHA, 05 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108146/))\n\n48 hours after the impact of Hurricane Rafael in western and central Cuba, preliminary figures show significant damage to homes, electrical infrastructure and basic services, as well as agriculture, in a context of ongoing response to Hurricane Oscar, which affected eastern Cuba three weeks ago. [...] \n\nSo far, no human losses have been reported, and specialized brigades have been deployed from nearby provinces to support the recovery, including the restoration of basic services and cleaning up debris. The greatest damage is concentrated in the province of Artemisa, where the hurricane severely impacted its 11 municipalities. The intense damage includes the demolition of 10 electricity towers. Several communities are cut off or very difficult to access due to falling trees and power lines, as well as flooding and overflowing rivers. ([UNCT Cuba, 08 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4109177/))\n\nApproximately 800,000 people have suffered the damages caused by this powerful hurricane in the most exposed territories of Artemisa, Mayabeque, Havana and Isla de la Juventud. [...] \n\nFollowing Hurricane Rafael, severe damage to the electrical system caused the water supply to be affected in the western provinces. A week after the impact, in the province of Artemisa, only 17% of the inhabitants had recovered the water supply service and in Havana, only 20%. In Mayabeque, the interruption of electricity service and water pumping continued in the municipalities of Batabanó, Quivicán, Melena del Sur and Nueva Paz. [...]\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Rafael has so far left (damage is still quantified), some 25,471 homes with various damages, concentrating its impact in the province of Artemisa with more than 83% of the damage. Severe effects predominate considering the ravages of strong category 3 winds. As a result, some 92,000 victims have been identified. At the same time, around 60,000 people (20,000 families) have been identified with severe problems in accessing electricity; they have had coverage with small photovoltaic systems as an immediate alternative, among others to access water. At the same time, damage to the conventional power grid has affected an additional 305,000 people. [...]\n\nWith Hurricane Rafael, a total of 144 health institutions were damaged in the three affected provinces of the western region. These include 28 hospitals, 43 polyclinics, 123 family doctor's offices and 51 other types of clinics. In Artemisa, significant damage is reported in two hospitals, the José Ramón Martínez Pediatric Hospital in Guanajay and the Ciro Redondo García General Hospital in the municipality of Artemisa.
