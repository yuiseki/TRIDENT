        "description": "A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclonic storm “Remal” and it is expected to make landfall near West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts around midnight between 26 and 27 May. Wind speed ranging 90-120 kmph (with a maximum up to 135) and a surge height ranging 3-4 m are expected in the coastal areas of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Hatia, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barisal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. There is a particular alert for Rohingya camps and hill districts for heavy rainfall and subsequent landslide risks. The overall potential exposed population is 1.9 million, who may be displaced during the cyclone, with almost 0.5 million houses estimated to be possibly damaged or destroyed. ([ECHO, 26 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065093/))\n\nA tropical storm named REMAL formed over the northern Bay of Bengal on 25 May. It made landfall over the border area between India, West Bengal state and Bangladesh, Khulna division on 26 May around 18.00 UTC. Tidal surges as high as 12 feet, heavy rainfall, and wind speeds of up to 120 km/h have led to inundation of many southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters. Tens of thousands of volunteers had been mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) to quicken the evacuation efforts and relief has already been transported to remote areas. 10,599 houses are so far reported fully destroyed, while 18,605 are reported partially destroyed, and 9 people are reported dead. Millions are without power. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected over West Bengal and most of Bangladesh.

More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4074688))\n\n**Bangladesh** has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal [...] and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country [...]. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. ([UNICEF, 21 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4087939))\n\nBy September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in **Bangladesh** have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts.
