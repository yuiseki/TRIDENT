        "description": "Since 30 June, continuous heavy rain and swollen rivers have caused flash floods in Kachin State, impacting several townships, including the state capital, Myitkyina. In Bhamo Township, approximately 3,500 people have been displaced to nine evacuation sites. In Sumprabum Township, riverbank collapses have destroyed houses, water erosion has damaged parts of the road, and landslides have affected the road between Myitkyina and Puta-O. The flood-affected population has received food, water, and other assistance from the de facto authorities and partners. On 5 July, partners conducted a rapid needs assessment at 26 sites. ([OCHA, 9 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076439))\n\nAmid the ongoing conflict in many parts of the country, Myanmar continues to grapple with flooding during the monsoon season. Since the end of June, low-lying areas along various rivers, especially Ayeyarwady and Chindwin, have been affected. In the northwest, more than 15 townships in Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing have been affected, with an estimated 118,000 people being temporarily evacuated to safer places since the beginning of July. Sagaing has been the hardest hit, with at least 11 townships flooded, followed by Mandalay, which had four townships affected. In Kachin, approximately 37,000 people in several townships were also temporarily evacuated due to the flash flooding on 30 June. Most of the flood-affected population in Myitkyina and Waingmaw townships have returned home as water levels have receded. Immediate lifesaving assistance was provided by humanitarian partners and local authorities in Kachin and in the northwest. ([OCHA, 16 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4078287))\n\nIn Myanmar, the monsoon season has brought prolonged heavy rainfall which caused flooding over Kachin, Kayin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady (DDM). According to reports from DDM as of 4 August, approximately 230,000 persons or 56,000 households affected. As of reporting, more than 120,000 persons are still displaced in 445 temporary evacuation places in 46 townships from 10 regions/states. An estimated 196,750 USD worth of assistance has been provided to the affected community from Myanmar Authorities. ([AHA Centre, 4 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4083733/))\n\nAccording to DDM Myanmar as of 6 August, a total of 59,000 families (240,000 individuals) affected over Kachin, Kayin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady. According to the report, 2 persons have been reportedly dead (1 from Kayin and 1 from Sagaing). As of 6 August, over 28,000 families (110,000 individuals) still displaced in 399 temporary evacuation centres and in their relative homes over 36 townships from Kayin, Tanintharyi, Bago, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady. ([AHA Centre, 7 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4084336/))\n\nDue to ongoing monsoon rains, widespread flooding continues to be reported at different locations along the main rivers, affecting the Ayeyarwady delta, Rakhine, Mon, Tanintharyi coastal areas, and regions including Yangon and Bago. This situation is exacerbated by Typhoon Gaemi, which struck Taiwan with wind speeds of 127 mph on 25 July. The residual clouds from the typhoon moved towards Myanmar, Thailand, and China, potentially generating further flooding and heavy rainfall in these regions. ([IFRC, 10 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4085306))\n\nSince the end of June, torrential monsoon rains and overflow of various rivers have submerged several states and regions from the north to the south of the country. Flooding temporarily affected Kachin State in early July and Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing regions across the Northwest around mid-July. Several townships in Rakhine State have been submerged since the last week of July, although the water level has been receding. Since 25 July, there has been widespread flooding in southeastern Myanmar, with multiple townships being inundated in the states and regions of Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Mon and Tanintharyi. Countrywide, it is estimated that the flooding has affected more than 393,000 people, resulting in the temporary displacement of many families, damages to and disruption of roads, railways and the movement of goods, destruction of paddy fields and livelihoods, and closure of schools. ([OCHA, 16 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4086811/))\n\nDG ECHO has replenished the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (IFRC-DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with € 200,000 to support victims of heavy flooding in Myanmar, which has affected more than 100,000 people. The allocation will help the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) scale up ongoing humanitarian assistance for communities in the most affected areas: Ayeyarwady and Bago region (East and West), Kayin and Mon states, Tanintharyi and Yangon regions. The primary focus of this allocation will be essential household items, cash for immediate necessities, first aid and health support including hygiene items and hygiene promotion to prevent waterborne diseases for 15,000 people in urgent need of assistance. This includes families whose houses were damaged or destroyed, single-parent households with children under five, older persons, and people with disabilities. ([ECHO, 28 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4089666/))\n\nSince 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of [Typhoon Yagi](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/52147) have led to severe flooding across Myanmar. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state’s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan. There has been significant damage to road networks, transportation, telecommunications, and electricity in affected areas. Most areas remain flooded, although some townships have started to see receding water levels. While data verification is challenging, an estimated 631,000 people might have been affected by flooding across the country. ([OCHA, 18 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094685/))\n\nTen days after the extensive flash flooding, emerging reports of impact indicate that an estimated 887,000 people, including displaced people, have been affected in 65 townships across Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Nay Pyi Taw, Rakhine, Sagaing and eastern and southern Shan regions/states. So far, more than 300 fatalities and nearly 100 injuries have been reported. The most severely affected areas remain in devastation, with widespread destruction to homes, household assets, water sources, and electricity infrastructure. Roads, bridges, communication networks, schools, public service facilities, religious sites, and crops and farmlands have been severely damaged or completely collapsed. ([OCHA, 20 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4095648/))\n\nAs of 26 September, an estimated 1 million people across 70 out of the 330 townships in Myanmar are reportedly affected by the flooding from heavy monsoon rains and remnants of [Typhoon Yagi](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/52147). This widespread flooding has caused significant damage in the Northwest, Southeast, and Rakhine State. More than 360 people have reportedly drowned, with at least 100 more missing due to the severe flooding. The floods have caused widespread devastation, submerging thousands of crops, farmlands, and livestock, leading to substantial losses in the livelihoods of affected communities. ([OCHA, 27 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097485/))\n\nAbout 300,000 children have been directly affected by the floods, with many schools closed, damaged, or being used as temporary shelters, exacerbating the hardships faced by children already enduring the brunt of ongoing conflict. Homes, household assets and critical infrastructure including health facilities, schools, water and sanitation services, major highways and bridges have been significantly damaged. Many families have been forced to evacuate as livelihoods have also been destroyed. Communication challenges continue due to the flooded roads and destroyed electric lines. Although there has been a decrease in floodwaters in some areas, recurring flooding and potential river overflows continue to be a threat due to the ongoing rain and riverine conditions. Across all affected areas, critical needs include access to safe drinking water, hygiene items, medicine, food, shelter, and humanitarian cash assistance.
