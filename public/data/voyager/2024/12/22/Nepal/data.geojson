According to the Nepal Police, 104 people were killed, 64 people have gone missing, and 73 people have been injured. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people were killed by landslides and flash floods. At least 1,545 families are displaced. Security forces have been mobilized for ongoing search and rescue operations. The municipality, National Red Cross Society, and civil societies are responding to the affected population.

([ECHO, 29 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097674))\n\nThe death toll and damage caused by heavy rain that has resulted in flooding and landslides in central and western Nepal is increasing. According to media, as of 30 September, at least 193 people died, including 34 in the capital Kathmandu, 31 are still missing, and 96 have been injured. In addition, three highways have been blocked by landslides isolating Kathmandu, and schools have been closed. ([ECHO, 30 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097835))\n\nAccording to media reports, as of 1 October, 217 people died, including 35 due to a landslide in Dhading district, in Bagmati province, southern Nepal. National authorities and Save the Children report that 111 people have been injured, 4,000 have been rescued, a total of 540 people have been displaced, and 5,000 have been affected.

([ECHO, 1 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098189))\n\nThe rainfall recorded on 26 and 27 September has been identified as the heaviest ever recorded in Nepal's history. In response, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) activated its Simplified Early Action Protocol (sEAP) following a decision made during the advisory committee meeting (comprising NRCS and IFRC representatives) on 26 September. The sEAP was triggered to support communities living in the Babai and West Rapati river basins in the western part of the country. ([IFRC, 3 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098960))\n\nOne week after the onset of heavy rainfall in Nepal, more than 81,000 people are estimated to be affected by floods and landslides. It is estimated that more than 230 people, including 55 children (20 girls and 35 boys) have died, with many others injured or reported missing. An estimated 4,667 houses are fully destroyed while 5,310 houses are partially damaged. Landslides and rubble have blocked major roads into the Katmandu Valley, hampering access to goods and critical services, including healthcare. Reports of increase in food prices and other essential items in the valley have begun. Access to critical services is affected, with 62 health facilities, 550 water supply systems, and 9,000 sanitation facilities damaged. UNICEF is concerned about possible disease outbreaks, including cholera and dengue fever. More than 190 schools have been damaged, affecting 23,000 students. ([UNICEF, 4 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099089/))\n\nAs of 03 October, 236 people have been killed, 173 injured, and 19 remain missing, while 17,120 have been rescued. The estimated damage includes NPR 4.35 billion to energy infrastructure, NPR 2.5 billion to roads and bridges, and over NPR 6 billion to agriculture. Hydropower projects, schools, health facilities, and communications have been severely affected across impacted areas. [...] While the floodwater in affected areas is receding, the risk of communicable disease outbreaks is heightened, including waterborne (Acute Gastroenteritis, Cholera, Hepatitis-A/E), rodent-borne (Leptospirosis), vector-borne (Dengue, Malaria), and vaccine-preventable diseases (Tetanus, Measles). Overcrowding in displacement camps also raises concerns about COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks, while health service disruptions may impact treatment for TB, HIV, and other diseases. ([UN RC Nepal, 7 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099545/))\n\nThe humanitarian impact has increased following widespread floods and landslides that have affected several parts of Nepal since 26 September.

More than 17,000 people have been rescued through various rescue operations that deployed more than 30 thousand security personnel. The Nepal Government has declared 71 municipalities across 20 districts as disaster crisis/emergency zones due to the severe impacts of landslides and floods. ([Govt. of Nepal, 16 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103889))\n\nAs of 5 November 2024, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) conducted a detailed assessment in 6 of the most affected and targeted districts namely, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhuli, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Ramechhhap and Panchthar in October 2024. The teams on the ground have reported more than 5,300 households (approximately 26,500 people) across these districts have been affected. Due to the severe impact of the floods and landslides, the affected families still do not have access to basic services like water, transportation, communication and electricity services have not been restored in some of the remote areas. According to the NRCS District Chapters, most of the displaced families are staying in the rented houses, few of them are still living under tarpaulin or with their relatives.
