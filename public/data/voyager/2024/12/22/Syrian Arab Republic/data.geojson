        "description": "Since October 29, 2024, there has been a marked increase in fire intensity, particularly in the Homs and Lattakia governorates. The majority of the fires have been reported in rugged mountainous and remote areas. The size and severity of certain bushfires have produced localized weather phenomena, that trap heat and generate strong winds, further exacerbating the fire situation. High wind conditions have facilitated the rapid spread of the flames, with some fires crossing highways and roads. The lack of capacity for the firemen such as vehicles and fuel are some of many other factors affecting the capacities of public services due to the continuities of Syrian crisis including the impact of different inputs (the Middle East crisis, the sanctions, climate change, etc.). Separate fires also occurred in Tartous governate however the scale of those fires was contained with minimal impact on the local population, while the fires in Homs and Lattakia could not be contained in the same manner. Until 03 November, the scale of the wildfires was limited to mountains in both the regions which grew in the following 2-3 days affecting the local population and its livelihoods.
