        "description": "Super Typhoon Kong-Rey (locally known as Leon) entered the PAR on 26 October. It passed over the far northern region of Luzon, affecting some of the remote islands in the area. Leon brought typhoon-strong winds, heavy rain, flooding, and landslides to the northern islands and the extreme northern mainland of the Philippines before exiting on 1 November. ([IFRC, 21 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4112400))\n\nTropical cyclone KONG-REY passed over southern and central Taiwan in the morning (UTC) of 31 October as a typhoon, with maximum sustained winds up to 185 km/h (typhoon). After that it continued northeastward over the coastal Zhejiang province, eastern China and the northern East China Sea, further weakening and dissipating on 1 November. Its passage over Taiwan caused very heavy rainfall, strong winds, floods and severe weather-related incidents across the whole island, resulted in casualites and damage. Media reports, as of 4 November, three fatalities, of which one in the Nantou county, one in the Taoyuan city area and one more in the Taipei city area. In addition, media also reports more than 690 injured people across the island. ([ECHO, 4 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4107672))\n\nThe combined impact of Typhoons [Kristine](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/52184), Leon, Marce, Nika, Ofel and [Pepito](https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/52208) caused widespread damage across 19 regions in the Philippines. As of 20 November, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that over 10 million people have been affected, with over 1 million displaced. Many are residing either in evacuation centres or taking shelter with their relatives or friends. \n\nThe combined effects of STS Kristine and STY Leon left over 200,000 homes damaged and more than 111,898 hectares of crops washed away, severely affecting transportation and communication networks. These two storms are the deadliest tropical cyclones to hit the Philippines this year. ([IFRC, 21 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4112400))\n\nOver 47,544 people, or 11,599 families, remain displaced across 10 regions due to the combined effects of Severe Tropical Storm (STS) Kristine and Super Typhoon (STY) Leon. Damaged houses increased to 326,562, of which 30,941 were totally damaged (destroyed) and 295,561 partially damaged (repairable). This is due to the combined effects of STS Kristine, STY Leon, Typhoon (TY) Marce, TY Nika, STY Ofel, and STY Pepito as well as effects of the shear line bringing rain over the previously affected areas.
