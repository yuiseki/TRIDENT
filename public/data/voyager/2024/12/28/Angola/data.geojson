        "description": "In Southern Africa, the impact of El Ni√±o began in November 2023 and has continued into the first quarter of 2024, with high temperatures and below average rainfall reported. A record mid-season dry spell has affected vast parts of the region including, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe ... The evolving drought crisis in Southern Africa is expected to continue to worsen already dire food insecurity levels, further driving malnutrition and spreading diseases like cholera. Reports indicate that the impact of these dry conditions in Southern Africa is likely to be long-lasting, with FEWS NET projections indicating the possibility of elevated needs for food assistance during the lean season in early 2025. ([IFRC, 14 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4070454))\n\nAn estimated 1.0 to 1.5 million people in Angola will likely need humanitarian food assistance by January 2025, primarily in south and east Angola, which have experienced repeated droughts, particularly in the provinces of Cunene, Cuando Cubango, Moxico, and parts of Namibe and Huila. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in these areas.\nMany households in the rest of the country will likely experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes through January 2025 due to more favorable rainfall driving relatively better harvest prospects and labor opportunities from land preparation, weeding, and planting.
