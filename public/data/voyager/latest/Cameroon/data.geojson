        "description": "Severe flooding in Cameroon's Far North region has affected over 158,620 people, including 38,069 women of reproductive age and 4,133 pregnant women. The hardest-hit areas are Mayo-Tsanaga, Mayo-Danay, and Logone-and-Chari divisions, with significant damage to infrastructure, farmland, and disruption of essential services. UNFPA has deployed midwives and social workers to affected areas and is coordinating with partners to track displacement and assess needs. UNFPA-supported health facilities continue to operate in some areas, providing essential SRH and GBV services. The response efforts are focusing on food security, shelter, non-food items, health (including SRH), and water, hygiene, and sanitation. Ongoing heavy rains and the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera, pose additional challenges to the humanitarian response. UNFPA is urgently appealing for USD 1,174,045 to scale up SRH and GBV interventions in flood-affected areas, targeting 129,149 people. ([UNFPA, 3 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091202))\n\nCameroon's Far North region has been experiencing flooding since the start of the rainy season, which began in the second half of July with an average rainfall frequency of one day out of four. The intensification and recurrence of rains starting from August 10, 2024, has led to a progressive increase in rainfall levels between August 10 and August 19, 2024. Series of floods have been recorded since August 19, reaching critical levels in the Logone et Chari and Mayo Danay divisions between August 11 and 21, 2024.

The most affected districts are Blangoua, Mackary, and Zina in the Logone and Chari department, and Maga, Yagoua in the Mayo Danay division.
