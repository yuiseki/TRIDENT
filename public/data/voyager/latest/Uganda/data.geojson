        "description": "Since the end of April, heavy rainfall has been affecting several parts of Uganda, causing floods and leading to casualties and damage. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as many as 49 people died, 28 are still missing, and 296 others have been injured. In addition, almost 18,500 people have been displaced and 39,185 affected across more than 15 districts of the country. For the next 48 hours, moderate rain is expected across the northern, central and southern parts of Uganda. With DG ECHO support, IFRC, through the Uganda Red Cross Society, is providing assistance with distribution of Non-Food Items (NFIs), de-silting kits to de-silt water channels and construct partly destroyed shelters, deployment of Red Cross volunteers, and is engaged in the search and rescue response along with district authorities. ([ECHO, 15 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4062536))\n\nIn April 2024, the Eastern Uganda-Elgon region experienced heavy rainfall, as forecasted by the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). This resulted in significant impacts from episodic floods, hailstorms, and landslides in various areas, including Mbale, Kapchorwa, Bulambuli, Bukedea, Butaleja, Sironko, Bududa, and Namisindwa. A total of 18,323 people were affected, including thousands of displaced families, with 1,129 houses and several crop lands and infrastructures completely destroyed. The rains intensified in the first half of May, causing water levels to rise and rivers such as Manafwa, Lwakhakha, Sironko, Mpologoma, Awoja, Nbuyonga, and Namatala to overflow, increasing the water flow from the slopes of Mount Elgon. Unprecedented flooding occurred, especially between May 7th and 11th, exacerbating the impacts experienced throughout April. By mid-May, 39,185 people had been affected by the floods, compounding the already dire humanitarian situation from April. Further, Ntoroko district witnessed its ever-recorded highest levels of flooding in August whose assessment reveals that 2,355 households comprising of 11,775 people have been greatly impacted.

Uganda Red Cross reports, as of 9 September, two fatalities, 1,469 households affected in 13 villages and more than 120 homes have been damaged or destroyed, leaving hundreds of families without shelter. ([ECHO, 10 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4092745))\n\nFollowing heavy rains on 27 November, the Bulambuli district in the Mount Elgon subregion has been severely affected by flooding and landslides. The roads have been cut-off by flood waters, including the main road from Sironko town to Kapchowa town, a bridge swept away and the River Simu has burst its banks. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) indicates that 125 people are unaccounted for, and at least 15 people have been killed by landslide. Death toll may increase further. At least 22 people have been injured and are receiving medical attention in a local health centre. Local authorities have indicated that the majority of killed and injured people are children. Close to 1,000 people have been displaced. ([ECHO, 29 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4114459))",

        "description": "Following heavy rains of 27th November 2024 across Bulambuli District and the neighboring districts, the flooding was triggered by the overflow of River Simu, which inundated nearby households, destroyed crops, and disrupted major roads, including Sironko-Kapchorwa and Muyembe-Nakapiripit. This led to the collapse of bridges and transport disruptions. Later that evening, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, the conditions also led to landslides events in eight villages in Buluganya parish and other areas in Sooti, Sisiyi, and Bulago sub-counties. While the floods have had impact in the riverine communities, the most significant impact and humanitarian need came from the landslides which caused extensive destruction, displacing thousands of families.
