        "description": "A new tropical cyclone named TRAMI (\"Kristine\" in the Philippines) formed over the western Philippine Sea on 20 October very early in the afternoon (UTC) and started moving west toward central-northern Luzon island, northern Philippines, strengthening. On 22 October at 0.00 UTC its centre was located over the sea, approximately 320 km east of the central Bicol region (southern Luzon island), with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (tropical storm). On the forecast track, TRAMI is expected to continue moving northwestward further strengthening and to make landfall over the eastern Cagayan Valley region, northern Luzon island on 23 October very early in the afternoon (UTC), with maximum sustained winds of 93 km/h (tropical storm). ([ECHO, 22 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103679))\n\nTropical storm TRAMI (named Kristine in the Philippines), is moving north-westwards and is approaching the north-eastern coasts of Luzon, northern Philippines.

NDRRMC reports, as of 28 October, 97 fatalities, 30 people still missing, 69 injured people, 6.7 million affected and over 980,000 displaced people. In central **Viet Nam**, ADINet reports one person still missing, four injured people, nearly 62,000 affected people, and around 15,500 damaged houses. On the forecast track, TRAMI is expected to continue moving eastward, re-entering in the South China Sea on 28-29 October, further weakening and dissipating. ([ECHO, 28 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4105250))\n\nTropical cyclone TRAMI is dissipating over the South China Sea after it made landfall over eastern Quang Nam province (eastern-central Vietnam) on 27 October. According to the ASEAN Disaster Information Network (ADINet), in Vietnam, one person died and another is still missing in Quang Binh province while five people have been injured across the provinces of Quang Tri and Quang Nam.

Approximately 7.1 million people were affected and 935,114 individuals displaced. 83,777 houses were damaged and more than 61,746 hectares of crops washed away, which severely affected transportation and communication networks. As of October, it was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2024. According to the Department of Education, PHP 3.3 billion worth of infrastructure was damaged in more than 38,000 schools. ([IFRC, 30 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4106369/))\n\nMore than 7.9m people (2m families) have been affected across 17 out of 18 regions in the **Philippines**.

([ECHO, 31 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4106516/))\n\nWhile STS Trami was exiting the **Philippine** Area of Responsibility (PAR), [Tropical Cyclone Kong-rey](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2024-000200-chn) (local name Leon), which intensified into a super typhoon, passed near the eastern seaboard of the country. The combined number of people affected by STS Trami and STY Kong-rey exceeded 8.8 million (about 2.25 million families). More than 711k people are still displaced, of which 194k people are in evacuation centres. Most of the displaced population is in Region 5, particularly in Camarines Sur and Albay Provinces, where the massive flooding occurred. The number of casualties have reportedly increased from the last reporting period; 151 reported deaths, 134 injured, and 21 missing. One of the hardest hit sectors is agriculture, with 111,411 farmers and fisherfolks affected. The estimated cost of damage to agriculture has reached over US$ 102 million (or PHP 6 billion). ([OCHA, 5 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4107957/))\n\nIn the **Philippines**, regions affected by Typhoon Kristine, including Region 2 (Cagayan Valley), Region 3 (Central Luzon) are facing issues like open defecation, uncollected trash, and outbreaks of diarrhea and measles. Despite pre-emptive evacuations helping reduce losses, the government’s water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies were insufficient.  ([UNICEF, 29 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4114365/)) As of 2 December, 3,300 households affected by STS Kristine in Libon, Albay and Camarines Sur (Milaor, Baao, Magarao and Bombon) received hygiene and water kits. ([UNICEF, 6 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4116196/))\n\nOver 47,544 people, or 11,599 families, remain displaced across 10 regions due to the combined effects of Severe Tropical Storm (STS) Kristine and Super Typhoon (STY) Leon. Damaged houses increased to 326,562, of which 30,941 were totally damaged (destroyed) and 295,561 partially damaged (repairable). This is due to the combined effects of STS Kristine, STY Leon, Typhoon (TY) Marce, TY Nika, STY Ofel, and STY Pepito as well as effects of the shear line bringing rain over the previously affected areas.

Over the next 24 hours, MAN-YI is forecast to continue eastwards strengthening. On 15-16 November, it could turn north-eastwards and it could approach central and northern Philippines on 17 November as a very strong typhoon. MAN-YI will be the sixth tropical cyclone since 20 October which will affect the Philippines, particularly the central and northern regions.

More than 719,000 people were preemptively evacuated. As of 19 November, the government has reported 7 fatalities, 30 injuries, and 2 missing, reflecting the level of preparedness measures despite the strength of the storm. Most affected areas were still in the recovery phase from prior cyclones, compounding the challenges faced by affected communities. Man-yi is the sixth cyclone to traverse the Philippines in one month, has now weakened to a severe tropical storm and poses no further threat. The last three tropical cyclones (Toraji, Usagi and Man-yi) have affected more than 1.8 million individuals, equating to approximately 495,788 families across Regions 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B and 5.
