        "description": "After historic floods, the Senegalese army has been mobilised to evacuate villagers and livestock in areas along the Senegal River in the north and east of the country. Despite no recent rains, many areas remain submerged, creating need for food, clean water, and shelter. Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye visited flood-affected areas in the east and north of the country, where, according to official government figures, over 55,600 people across 51 villages and 44 other sites have been affected by the rise of the Senegal River. More than 1,000 hectares of crops have been damaged in the regions of Tambacounda, Bakel, Matam, and Saint-Louis. Solidarity caravans are being organized, and Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko convened an emergency meeting on 20 October, following the announcement of the allocation of US$13.3 million for assistance.
