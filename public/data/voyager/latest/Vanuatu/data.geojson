        "description": "A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck 30 km west of Port Vila, Vanuatu, on 17 December 2024, at 12:47 PM local time. A tsunami warning was issued but has since been lifted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the time of reporting. Preliminary reports indicate observed damages to buildings and infrastructure in Port Vila, with six unconfirmed casualties and injuries reported. According to UNOSAT initial exposure analysis, an estimate of 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the earthquake. Telecommunications remain disrupted and is affecting the timeliness of field reports from remote areas. Access to the airport and water port is severely limited due to road damage. Key immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water, and the restoration of emergency communications.([OCHA, 17 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4119043))\n\nAs of 18th December, NDMO confirmed 14 fatalities either from collapsed buildings or landslides. The numbers may rise as search and rescue operations intensifies and expands. Over 200 are reported injured while many are still missing. According to UNICEF staff on the ground, most injuries are fractures, cuts and traumas related to falling objects and sharp items. According to NDMO, two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged. Assessment of water network is ongoing with affected residents already rationing water. ([UNICEF, 18 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4119369))\n\nApproximately 80,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, of which 14,104 are children and 769 are persons with disabilities (PWD). The Disaster Evacuation Centre Management Cluster (DEMC) reports that 947 people have been displaced. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides further obstructing road access in Efate and outer islands, including routes to the Seaport. The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights. Physical Access challenges continue to hamper response efforts. ([OCHA, 19 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4120223/))\n\nThe situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. VMGD has confirmed that approximately 300 aftershocks, ranging from magnitudes of 2.0 to 5.3, have occurred with shallow depths between December 17 and December 19. The earthquake has resulted in significant devastation, with the death toll rising to 14 (eight males, five females, one unknown) and 265 injuries. ([OCHA, 26 Dec 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4121629))\n\nTwo major water reservoirs in Port Vila sustained severe damage, and ongoing assessments of the water network have led to water rationing for residents. Port Vila International Airport resumed commercial flights on 22 December, following consultations with airport agencies. However, landslides and damaged roads and bridges have hindered access to the airport and seaport. While the airport is operational, the seaport is still closed. The situation is compounded by the ongoing cyclone season, with three tropical cyclones predicted in the region posing more risks to already vulnerable populations.
