    "description": "Initial reports indicate that an estimated 10,180 people, most of whom are newly arrived IDPs from Sennar State, have been affected by recent heavy rains and flooding in Kassala State. [...] Heavy rains and flooding have also affected an unspecified number of people and homes in Aroma, Shamal Al Delta, Reifi Kassala, and Gharb Kassala localities. [...] Floodwater reportedly submerged tents and water and sanitation (WASH) facilities, as well as roads. The majority of the affected IDPs have been forced to live in the open on the roadsides and they do not have access to food, clean drinking water, or safe sanitation facilities amid heightened concerns of a possible spike in water-borne diseases.
