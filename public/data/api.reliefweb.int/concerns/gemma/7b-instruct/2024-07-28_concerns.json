The rain, accompanied by strong winds, caused extensive material damage and loss of life (07 deaths, including 3 children under the age of 10 and 2 adults, a 35-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man, and 42 injured people treated in the various health centres. Two children under the age of 15 were evacuated to Ouagadougou for more appropriate care.\nAccording to initial reports, as of 07 June, more than 1,000 households had been affected. This has been confirmed by the current registration, which shows a provisional total of more than 1,147 households, or 7,648 people affected, and 925 houses either completely or partially destroyed.\nBurkina Faso is a country vulnerable to extreme rainfall and flooding, with major humanitarian consequences. Every year during the rainy season, thousands of people are affected. The country has in-country response capacity, but support remained needed. Official data from Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) received on 13 June 2024 indicates the affected households that required assistance and local Government expressed their request for support to the NS.

    "description": "On 24 July, the combined effects of the Southwest Monsoon, enhanced by Tropical Cyclone Gaemi(local name: Carina), brought heavy to intense rains across the Philippines. Northern Luzon, particularly the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Ilocos Norte, experienced severe impacts, while Central Luzon provinces Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija faced severe flooding and power outages. In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exitingthe Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA.  ([OCHA, 24 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4080598))\n\nSuper Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July.
