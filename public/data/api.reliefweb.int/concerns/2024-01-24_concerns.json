    "description": "From the 22nd - 28th December 2023, most parts of the country received heavy rainfall coupled with strong winds which caused severe damages affecting 190 households (968pp). The impacts of the shocks (heavy rains and storms) were mostly felt by communities mostly in Maseru and Quthing district and lower impact was reported Berea, Mokhotlong, Thaba Tseka. The storm severely damaged businesses and transport networks which hindered full access to essential services such as markets, health services and churches and the situation is expected to worsen in the coming months (January to March) as more rains have been projected by the Lesotho Meteorological Services. The affected families are displaced as their houses were blown away by storms and food stock are also destroyed by rains, as well as some small businesses in the districts. The families opted to seek for shelter with their neighbors and relatives as a temporary solution. ([IFRC, 21 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4031524))",
