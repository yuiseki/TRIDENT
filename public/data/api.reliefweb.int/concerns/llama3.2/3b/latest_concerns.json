    "description": "Afghanistan has been experiencing below-normal rainfall since October 2020. Such conditions are expected to continue through the first half of 2021 in the country according to forecasters. The conditions have affected the winter season snow accumulation, which is critical for water access during the spring and summer agricultural seasons. It is anticipated that the situation will have an impact on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture/livestock, as well as on the availability of water for drinking, washing, and sanitation. Mid-March through to the end of July will likely be the peak period during which drought impacts on crops and livestock (agricultural drought) would manifest. The wheat production deficit is expected to be 16 to 27 per cent this year and as a result, requiring increased top-up from international suppliers. Such drivers would further affect communities already suffering from the ongoing economic crises exacerbated by the secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including high prices of basic commodities, conflict, and food insecurity. \n\nThe ongoing food insecurity situation is very much worse than the previous years. According to the IPC report, from November 2019 to March 2020, 2,695,000 people were in IPC phase 4 and 8,591,000 people were in IPC phase 3. Based on the same IPC report (produced recently by Food Security Cluster and Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock), between November 2020 and March 2021 – a period that corresponds to the lean season –around 13.15 million people (42% of the total population) have been experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), out of which nearly 4.3 million people are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and an estimated 8.85 million people are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Moreover, only five provinces of the country were in IPC phase 4 in the first quarter of 2020, but by March 2021, 10 provinces of the country are classified in IPC phase 4. ([IFRC, 19 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3723898))\n\nNearly 11 million people in Afghanistan are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) due to conflict, COVID-19, high food prices and rampant unemployment, between March and May 2021 (the lean season in most parts of the country.) This includes around 7.8 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 3.2 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and require urgent action to save lives, reduce food gaps and save and protect livelihoods. Between June and November 2021 (harvest and post-harvest seasons), a slight improvement in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above decreasing to 9.5 million, with 6.7 million in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 2.7 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). The areas that were in Phase 4 in the current analysis period are expected to remain in Phase 4 in the projection period, despite slight seasonal improvements. It is likely that household’s food access will improve slightly with the onset of the harvest, better job opportunities, as well as seasonal decreases in prices; however, rainfall forecasts suggest that the harvest will be below average, which will likely affect food availability during the following lean season. The food security situation has relatively improved compared to the last three years, aside from the impacts of drought in 2018 and the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. However, the food security situation is still concerning and expected to deteriorate further during the 2021-2022 lean season. ([IPC, 22 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3732293))\n\nAs per a multi-sectoral needs’ analysis conducted by the Inter Cluster Country Team (ICCT), 25 provinces are estimated to be highly impacted by drought, although the drought has not yet been officially declared by the government of Afghanistan. The impact of the climatic events, storm-related flooding, conflict, and COVID-19 will vary across regions based on the degree to which these phenomena manifest and interact with pre-existing vulnerabilities in various locations The drought will likely result in nearly an additional 110,000 children who will be severely acutely malnourished and at risk of dying. Along with recent increases due to worsening insecurity and COVID-19, there will be nearly 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Afghanistan over the next year. ([UNICEF, 31 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3743034))\n\nDrastic reduction in rainfall has caused levels of food and water scarcity across 25 provinces in Afghanistan not seen since the drought of 2018 that displaced a quarter of a million people. An International Rescue Committee assessment of drought impact in Herat, Badghis, Pakitya, Helmand and Khost provinces has shown that 83% of 484 people interviewed are already experiencing displacement within their communities. Interviewees said that some families are being pushed towards extreme survival measures such as selling off their assets, livestock reducing the number of meals, and child marriage. 75% respondents reported an increase in conflict arising in areas where water supplies have depleted. 81% of participants with children under the age of 5 reported diarrhea and illness owing to a lack of clean water. ([IRC, 15 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3747516))\n\nOn 22 June, the Government of Afghanistan officially declared a drought in the country. Little snow pack accumulation over the winter months and low rainfall in recent weeks resulted in drought conditions, low crop yields and rising food prices in the southern, eastern and western parts of the country. In the South, farmers in Kandahar Province are reporting water shortages which are threatening agricultural outputs. In the East, reduced food production is expected to contribute to an already dire food security situation exacerbated by the effects of La Niña and a continued dry spell. In the West, the provinces of Hirat, Badghis and Ghor are facing either extreme or severe drought conditions and humanitarian partners are assisting vulnerable people with food, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash and the rehabilitation of water sources. In the North-East region, drought does not pose an immediate threat at present, but forecasted water shortages may affect 60 per cent of farmers (about 586,000 people) in 12 districts during the upcoming agricultural seasons beginning in September 2021. The declaration of the drought comes at a time when Afghanistan is experiencing a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases and intensifying conflict against the background of ongoing peace talks and the withdrawal of US forces. In total, more than 12 million people – about one third of the population – are facing high levels of acute food insecurity due to high food prices, conflict, COVID-19, and widespread unemployment. ([OCHA, 28 Jun 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3751859))\n\nAccording to the Pre-Lean Season Assessment (PLSA), conducted across the country in Quarter 1 of 2021, on average, cereal stocks of the prior harvest lasted only five months for the entire households interviewed. Across all areas, only a small proportion (10 per cent) of households reported having cereal stocks from their products that would last till the next harvest. Access to wheat seeds remained a significant challenge. According to PLSA, 81 per cent of\nfarmers did not have access to certified wheat seeds to cultivate their lands during the last season. PLSA findings show that in rural areas, 53 per cent of people generate income from agriculture, while in the urban areas, only 9 percent of people do. Economic access to food is seriously compromised because of a significant increase in prices. Overall, an estimated 10-20 per cent price increase has been observed compared with the same period of the last five years. The increase is mainly due to the drought, COVID-19 related impacts, steadily accelerating year-on-year inflation and seasonal changes. To further compound the situation, the PLSA indicated a reduction in income for 75 per cent of people and an increase in debt. Around 73 per cent of households reported having debt, and 74 per cent cited food as the main reason for borrowing. With the increasing dependency on the market due to relatively lower production, increased prices, and debt, financial access to food is constrained for most households, as evidenced by the livelihood coping\nstrategy. One out of five households (20 per cent) adopted Emergency livelihood coping strategies, and 24 per cent resorted to Crisis livelihood coping strategies to mitigate their food consumption gaps. Moreover, the above-mentioned issues are compounded with years of conflict and instability that have caused livelihood disruption and displacements. Despite efforts for a peace deal, this has not yet translated into a sustained reduction in violence. In the first half of 2021, an estimated 140,691 people have been displaced. Internal displacement was limited to new IDPs. Still, IDPs from previous years were unable to return to their places of origin mainly because of continued conflict, loss of livelihoods, and a lack of economic opportunities. ([IFRC, 12 Jul 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3755666))\n\nAccording to the government, in 2021, the country’s wheat crop will be reduced by nearly two million tons due to this. More than three million livestock are also in danger of death due to lack of fodder and water. The drought has also exacerbated the hard living conditions in a country that is grappling with escalating conflict, COVID-19 and crippling poverty. COVID-19 cases have steadily risen since mid-May 2021, with compounding socioeconomic impacts. Moreover, the years of conflict and instability have caused livelihood disruption and displacements. Despite efforts for a peace deal, this has not yet translated into a sustained reduction in violence. In the first half of 2021, an estimated 140,691 people have been displaced due to armed clashes. Still, internally displaced people (IDPs) from previous years are unable to return to their places of origin mainly because of continued conflict, loss of livelihoods, and a lack of economic opportunities. The ongoing complex humanitarian emergencies – with the drought being the worst – in the country have not only increased the vulnerability but have severely impacted the living conditions and livelihoods in many parts of the country. The impacted populations are in need of emergency food assistance, lifesaving health care, and means to restore and protect their livelihoods. Currently, around 11 million people are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity due to conflict, COVID-19, high food prices, and rampant unemployment. ([IFRC, 3 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3761564))\n\nNeeds assessments and response such as health, nutrition, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene activities continued across the country. In the last week, 44,000 people received humanitarian aid in the north-east, while 22,000 people affected by drought received humanitarian assistance in the north. Decades of conflict and a severe drought has exacerbated the situation for vulnerable people. The economic situation continues to be of major concern in terms of the continuity of basic services and impact on the most vulnerable people. Price increases of staples continue to be reported along with scarcity of basic commodities which will impact overall humanitarian needs going forward. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3769675))\n\nIn a drought declaration by the government on 22 June 2021, the country’s wheat crop will be reduced by nearly two million tons. Additionally, more than three million livestock are in danger of perishing due to a lack of fodder and water. The winter season will start in October with a potential for severe impact on drought-affected and displaced people whose coping capacities are already weakened. The compounding impacts of drought and conflict which escalated in July and the first half of August have exacerbated the hard living conditions in a country that is also grappling with COVID-19 and poverty. ([IFRC, 6 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3771949))\n\nDuring the reporting period (1–15 September), 177,500 drought affected-people in Balkh and Nimroz provinces were assisted with water trucking. Water trucking is a last resort option to avoid displacements in areas where people rely on rainwater due to unavailability of potable water or due to high salinity groundwater [...] Afghanistan is currently facing the second drought in four years and consequent water scarcity which is impacting a third of the country. The WASH Cluster stress that the current drought is first and foremost a water scarcity crisis. In addition to the precipitation forecast, there is urgent need to set up a nationwide groundwater monitoring systems to closely follow the water levels across the country. ([OCHA, 23 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3776659/))\n\nIn September and October 2021 (the post-harvest season), nearly 19 million people in Afghanistan experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), an almost 30% increase from the same season last year (14.5 million people). The main drivers of acute food insecurity include drought and its impacts on crops and livestock, the collapse of public services, a severe economic crisis and increasing food prices. An estimated 6.8 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 11.9 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) require urgent action to save their lives, reduce food gaps and protect their livelihoods. Between November 2021 and March 2022 (the winter lean season), a further deterioration in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above increasing to 22.8 million, a nearly 35% increase from the same season last year (16.9m). Out of 22.8 million people, 14 million will likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 8.7 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The number of areas in Emergency is expected to significantly increase in the projection analysis period from 21 to 32 analytical domains. It is likely that household food access between the end of winter and the following spring season will further deteriorate due to: the continuing La Niña climatic episode bringing below-average winter precipitation for the second consecutive year, the impact of high food prices, sanctions on the de facto authorities, growing unemployment and possibly increased displacement. Reduced incomes, lower international and domestic remittances and continuing obstacles to humanitarian assistance (many related to the financial crisis and limited physical access during the winter period) are expected to contribute to the deterioration of food security. ([IPC, 25 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3785295/))\n\nDuring the reporting period (1 September–31 October), WASH Cluster partners assisted 198,656 drought-affected people across Balkh, Badghis, Kandahar, Hilmand and Wardak province with water trucking to avoid displacement. The country is currently facing the second drought in four years and the worst of its kind in 27 years. The recently updated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis shows the food security situation has further deteriorated with worrying implications for the winter lean season ahead. [...] In rural areas, this is largely driven by the drought. Assessments show that even after harvest, 57 per cent of households do not have food reserves that would last for 3 months. In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity. 10 out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be in IPC 4 (Emergency). ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3788440))\n\nBetween 1 September and 15 November, UN and partners provided 7.2 million people with food assistance; reached more than 880,000 people with primary and secondary health-care consultations; they assisted almost 199,000 drought-affected people through water trucking; and treated more than 178,000 children under five for acute malnutrition. Afghanistan’s Flash Appeal seeking $606 million to help 11 million people most in need in the last four months of 2021 is 100 per cent funded. However, all financial commitments have not been translated into actions on the ground, due to financial system challenges amid the cash and liquidity crisis. ([OCHA, 22 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794125))\n\nMore than 507,728 people were reached with WASH assistance including through hygiene promotion and hygiene kits between 1 September and 15 December. WASH Cluster partners have continued to assist 204,033 drought-affected people with water trucking – with operations ongoing across Badghis, Kandahar, and Nimroz provinces. Water trucking is a last resort option to avoid displacements in areas where people rely on rainwater due to unavailability of potable water or due to high salinity groundwater. 8,329 wells across 24 provinces are benefitting from regular chlorination able to support up to 3 million people. [...] Drought is not only a food security crisis – the drop down of safe drinking water and water for handwashing have led to the spread of the Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreak, particular affecting children. 18 provinces are currently facing catastrophic AWD situation. ([OCHA, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803989/))\n\nBetween 1 September and 30 December, WFP reached approximately 9.4 million people with food assistance across 34 provinces. The majority of this consists of unconditional emergency food or cash-based assistance to meet emergency food needs and protect livelihoods as well as support to displaced populations (IDPs, refugees and returnees). The number of people requiring assistance is more than what was planned under the Appeal mainly due to the increased food insecurity as highlighted by the last IPC report. ([OCHA, 11 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3807536/))\n\nWith each passing month, new waves of people are turning to drastic measures to feed their families. Two-thirds of the population (66 percent) are now resorting to crisis coping strategies - a staggering eight percentage point increase from the previous month and a sixfold increase since 15 August' Many (60 percent) are resorting to four or more strategies, and parents are increasingly restricting their own meals just so their children can eat (66 percent)...As of end-January, 95 percent of the population have insufficient food consumption. Some areas saw a deterioration, such as the Central Highlands and North regions where food consumption is already the poorest. In addition, the number of people with severe food insecurity increased in Kabul, North and West regions.  ([WFP, 31 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3818714/))\n\nTwo-thirds of the population of Afghanistan are now resorting to crisis-level coping strategies to feed their families. This is an eight percentage point increase from December and a sixfold increase since August 2021, according to WFP’s latest Food Security Update for Afghanistan. Almost 100 percent of female-headed households are facing insufficient food consumption. Eight in ten households experienced a significant decrease in income during the month of January. Households in Kabul were hit the hardest, where some families braved the harsh winter season without any income at all. 22.8 million people – half of the population – are projected to be acutely food insecure in 2022, including 8.7 million at risk of famine-like conditions, with all 34 provinces are facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity. ([OCHA, 7 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3824732))\n\nThe severe drought affecting most of the country since early 2021 has crippled crop production and livestock, leading to critical food shortages. Food insecurity is affecting both rural and urban areas. Ten out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are projected to be under IPC 4 – emergency food insecurity, due to the developments in the country that have driven up unemployment, prices of food and household items as well as cashflow problems (unavailability of remittances and salary payments). The snowfall during the 2021-2022 winter season has remained low, which is likely to further exacerbate the drought situation in the new agricultural year. ([IFRC, 26 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3831467))\n\nWhile humanitarian assistance is driving down severe food insecurity in several regions of Afghanistan, the number of people facing insufficient food consumption remains alarmingly high, with only 7 percent of people reported having enough to eat in March. The results of an ongoing Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment are expected soon. Currently, 22.8 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food insecure (IPC 3 and 4). In April, WFP reached 12 million people with food & nutrition support. Between January and March 2022, humanitarian partners reached 18 million people with at least one form of humanitarian assistance, including 17.6 million vulnerable people; 174,000 cross-border returnees; 74,000 refugees; 66,000 people affected by floods and other weather-related events; and 65,000 newly displaced people. ([OCHA, 2 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3843860))\n\nHigh acute food insecurity persists across Afghanistan, as a combination of a collapsing economy and drought is depriving nearly 20 million Afghans of\nfood, classified in Crisis or Emergency (IPC Phases 3 or 4), between March and May 2022 (the lean season). Among these, about 6.6 million people\nare classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), characterized by large food gaps and/or employing emergency coping strategies to access food. For the first time since the introduction of IPC in Afghanistan, Catastrophe conditions (IPC Phase 5) were detected for 20,000 people in the province of Ghor, one of the most remote, vulnerable provinces of Afghanistan and immediate action is needed to prevent further deterioration. In the projected period, between June and November 2022, harvest will allow a minimal improvement in food availability and access, from 19.7 Million people facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) to 18.9 million. Overall, 13 million will likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 6 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). At household level, the situation is compounded by the forecasted reduction of Humanitarian Food Assistance (HFA) after the month of May. HFA is expected to decrease from 38% of the population receiving on average two third food ration in the current period, to 8% in the June-November projection due to lack\nof funding. ([IPC, 9 May 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3844817))\n\nHunger levels continue to stagnate at alarming levels. For nearly nine months, over 90 percent of the population have faced insufficient food consumption. Despite marginal improvements, coinciding with further humanitarian food assistance and the end of winter, Afghanistan still faces the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally.' A concerning number of people are still turning to drastic coping strategies. Gradual improvements have been observed each month since February for the wider population. However, female-headed households are still largely relying on coping strategies (87 percent), with no clear trend of improvement for nearly nine months. Households are now spending 87 percent of their income on food - up from 85 and 83 percent in April and March respectively. ([WFP, 27 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3860592))\n\nThe situation remains precarious as household income continues to shrink. For the second month in a row, the country saw an increase in the proportion of households with deteriorating incomes. In June, this increased by an alarming 10 percentage points. Recurrent drought and erratic climatic shocks are also expected to result in a below average harvest - further threatening incomes and livelihoods.' People are spending almost all of their remaining income on food. Average expenditure on food has now increased to 90 percent - the highest since January 2022 (80 percent).' Female-headed households are spending an even higher proportion of their income on food (94 percent). This comes as incomes are shrinking and prices for key commodities are rising.  More than half of the population is still turning to drastic measures to put food on the table. ([WFP, 27 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3870287))\n\nAn estimated 18.9 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food-insecure (IPC 3+), according to the May 2022 IPC Analysis, including 6 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and 13 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Continued humanitarian assistance in Ghor Province is needed to deter IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) conditions, which affected some 20,000 people between March and May. Afghanistan continues to face the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally, as some nine in ten households struggle to meet their food needs, according to WFP’s latest Food Security Update: Round Eleven (July 2022). Household food expenditure share continued to increase, reaching 91 percent in July (up from 80 percent in January) while some six in ten households saw their incomes drop. ([WFP, 20 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3888077))\n\nAn estimated 18.9 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food-insecure (IPC 3+), according to the May 2022 IPC Analysis projected period for June –\nNovember, including 6 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and 13 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). WFP awaits the official endorsement of an updated\nIPC Analysis for the current period (September October) and food security projections for the upcoming lean season (November-March). Afghanistan continues to face the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally. Results from a special edition of the monthly WFP Food Security Update show that, on average, 92 percent of household income is spent on food, while 51 percent of households rely on coping strategies to meet their basic food needs. Nine in ten households continue to face insufficient food consumption. ([WFP, 7 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3903983))\n\nProlonged drought across the country, felt hardest in the Southern, Northern, and Western Regions, continued to impact the availability of and access to safe drinking water. A third consecutive La Niña weather event is likely to persist into the 2022-2023 winter, worsening drought conditions. According to the recent Whole of Afghanistan Assessment, 79 per cent  of households reported they do not have sufficient water for their daily needs, including for drinking, cooking, bathing or hygiene. In addition, 64 per cent of households reported that they experienced drought in the six months prior to data collection and 54 per cent experienced economic shock. The impact of both drought and economic shock is having a devastating effect on food security and family coping mechanisms. ([UNICEF, 20 Nov 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3908635))\n\nNearly 20 million people in Afghanistan are acutely food-insecure (IPC 3+), including more than 6 million people on the brink of famine-like conditions in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), according to preliminary projections for November 2022 to March 2023. Afghanistan continues to face the highest prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally. Results from WFP’s October Food Security Update show that nine in ten households consumed insufficient food, with little change over the past 12 months. The current food crisis is perpetuated by a concurrent climate crisis, as 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan report extremely low water quality. The proportion of households feeling the impact of drought in 2022 is six times greater than in 2020 as Afghanistan enters its third consecutive drought year. ([WFP, 22 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3919306))\n\nFour million pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children under five (6-59 months) are currently suffering from acute malnutrition, according to the latest IPC acute malnutrition analysis. This includes 3.2 million children, of which 875,227 are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), and 2.3 million are suffering from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). More than 804,000 PLW are acutely malnourished. Two provinces – Badakhshan and Paktika – are classified in IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 4 (Critical), while 23 other provinces are classified in IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 (Serious). The current food crisis is exacerbated by the climate crisis, as 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan reported extremely low water quality. ([WFP, 21 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3935665))\n\nSustained humanitarian assistance has effectively reduced the total number of food insecure people in Afghanistan, from 20 million during the winter lean season, to 15.3 million projected for May to October 2023. Continued support is needed to keep the alarming malnutrition and hunger rates from increasing. A 30-35 percent wheat deficit is expected for 2023 following the third consecutive drought year in Afghanistan. While forecasts suggest an overall improvement in wheat production from previous years, western provinces are likely to still experience below-average harvests. ([WFP, 25 Jun 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3975398))\n\nThe economy is unable to support a significant percentage of the population. Persistent drought has limited foreign investment, and the loss of international budgetary support has driven the economy downwards. Casual labour opportunities have picked up in some areas, but successive bans on employment have removed the vital contribution which women once made to household income. Overall, it is clear that current economic conditions cannot sustain the majority of Afghan families. Acute hunger remains persistently high. [...] More than 15 million Afghans (35 percent of the population) live in a state of acute hunger, as per the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3+ (crisis), while 2.8 million experience critical Emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4). A marginally better harvest and lower prices might lead to lower food insecurity numbers in the forthcoming forecast period (October 2023 - March 2024). However, the fact remains that between 30 percent and 50 percent of Afghan households currently cannot afford adequate nutritious food. ([WFP, 19 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4007314))\n\nAfghanistan’s economy remains exceedingly fragile, and the food insecurity remains alarmingly high. In October 2023, during the postharvest season, approximately 13.1 million people, accounting for 29 percent of the total population (based on 2024 Flowminder national population estimates) are facing high level of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). The main drivers of this acute food insecurity include challenging economic conditions, high unemployment rates compounded by the limited access to income that reduced purchasing power, in a context of continued high prices of food and agricultural inputs, reduced livelihood opportunities and decreased remittances. The adverse impact of extreme and variable climatic conditions, particularly the multi-year drought experienced between 2021 and 2023, continues to be felt in 2023. Additionally, other natural hazards such as flooding and earthquakes further compromise the limited coping capacity of the population, resulting in the persistence of a severe food insecurity situation. Looking ahead to the projection period between November 2023 and March 2024, corresponding to the winter lean season, a further deterioration in food security is expected, with the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above likely to rise to 15.8 million (36 percent of the total population based on Flowminder 2024 national population estimate), including about 3.6 million people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and about 12.3 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Compared to the same period of previous years, the decrease of number of people facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) during the lean season (November 2023 – March 2024), and especially in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), can be attributed predominantly to the extensive, timely and efficient delivery of humanitarian food and agriculture assistance. ([IPC, 14 Dec 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4023033))\n\nCrisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing in northern, western, and central highlands as households have decreased access to typically relevant income sources, and food stocks are limited from the 2023 harvest. [...] Despite the expectation for above-average precipitation associated with the ongoing El Nino, cumulative precipitation from October 2023 to January 2024 remains well below the 40-year average. Most of Afghanistan has received 60 to 90 percent of average precipitation for the October 2023 to late January 2024 period, with areas in northern and eastern Afghanistan recording less than 60 percent of average precipitation. In particular, much of eastern Afghanistan has recorded historically low precipitation between October 1, 2023, and January 25, 2024. ([FEWS Net, 31 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4034404))\n\nAt the peak of the lean season, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present in northern, northeastern, and western parts of the county following the early depletion of food stocks from 2023's below-average harvest, limited income-earning opportunities, and a decline in remittances from Iran, which is keeping household purchasing power low.[...] However, average March to May rainfall is expected to support wheat production and agricultural labor opportunities, improving household access to food and income. The start of the harvest in June is expected to improve household food access across the country, with area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes emerging in northern parts of the country as they recover from the multi-year drought. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to remain present in higher elevation areas, where the harvest does not typically occur until October, and household access to income for food purchases is expected to remain low. ([FEWS Net, 9 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4045023))\n\nIn January 2024, dry spell conditions gradually emerged in the Western, Northern, and North Eastern regions of the country, intensifying in severity in these areas throughout February and March. The provinces most severely impacted were Hirat, Badghis, Faryab, Jawzjan, Samangan, Baghlan, and Kunduz. Throughout February and March, regions that were moderately affected, such as the southern parts of Hirat, Farah, Nimroz, Hilmand, and most areas of Kandahar, began to recover from drought conditions. However, additional pockets of dry spell developed simultaneously in Uruzgan and Kandahar (Southern Region), as well as Nangahar and Kunar (Eastern Region). ([OCHA, 25 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4057587))\n\nAfghanistan continues to experience marginal improvements in food security since the large degradation in the situation following the political transition of 2021. Nonetheless, over a third of Afghanistan’s population (14.2 million people) are still experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), driven by climatic shocks and high food prices. This includes 2.9 million people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), the majority of whom are located in Badakshan, Baghdis, Ghor, Ghazni, Helmand, Herat (urban and rural), Kunduz, Kandahar and Takhar provinces. ([IPC, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065251))\n\n[...] La Niña conditions are likely to become more prevalent from August-October 2024 and are expected to persist through January-March 2025 with a 70-80 percent likelihood. Consequently, the start of the 2024/25 agricultural season is projected to face challenges, including below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures. [...] In June, conditions continued to improve in Afghanistan, particularly in the provinces of Bamyan, Ghor, Kabul, and Parwan, where vegetation growth was previously negatively impacted from May to mid-June. Despite some remaining pockets of dry spell across these provinces, an overall improvement is observed. By the end of June, a precipitation deficit was observed in a corridor crossing the provinces of Bamyan, Sar-e-Pul, Samangan, and Balkh.

    "description": "Mongolia is currently facing a severe Dzud. This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. ([UNICEF, 25 Jan 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4032456))\n\nAs a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. ([IFRC, 2 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4035085/))\n\nThe current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia's rural communities and traditional livelihoods. ([UN RC Mongolia, 6 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4036374/))\n\nAccording to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years’ data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. ([UNICEF, 21 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4039973/))\n\nAs of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. ([ECHO, 23 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4040820/))\n\n[...] The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock – nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold – Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. ([OCHA, 5 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4043598/))\n\n[...]  According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). ([IFRC, 15 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4046890/))\n\nBetween November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. ([UNICEF, 22 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4048939))\n\nThe situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. ([OCHA, 26 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4049776))\n\nHealth concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. [...] The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. [...] The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. ([IFRC, 4 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4052404))\n\nBetween November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. ([UNICEF, 1 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4059029))\n\nAlthough the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children.  Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. ([UNICEF, 4 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4068169/))\n\nOfficial estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food. ([FAO, 10 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4076926))\n\nIn addition to the Dzud impacts, the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) addressed the high risk of “yellow” floods due to accumulated snowfall and  livestock carcasses in Dzud-affected regions by the end of May 2024. However, NAMEM issued warning for potential floods during summertime from high precipitation levels forecasted. From June to August 2024, heavy rains and floods affected several Dzud-affected regions including Uvurkhangai, Tuv, Zavkhan, and Umnugobi, directly and indirectly impacting over 1,300 people and leading to the loss of 22,000 livestock. Furthermore, a series of wildfire struck the region most affected by the dzud including Khentii, Dornod, Sukhbaatar provinces between 11-16 October, directly affecting 21 families,  resulting in the loss of two children and 1,000 livestock, and burning 16 hectares of pastureland. These recurring hazards continue to compound the difficulties faced by Dzud-affected herder communities. As of 25 October, NAMEM has issued seasonal weather forecasts for October 2024 to January 2025 and MoFALI has updated pasture carrying capacity estimates and September update on the winter preparation for 2024/2025. According to NAMEM forecast, the temperatures may fluctuate between October, November, December 2024, and January 2025, with warmer conditions anticipated for October and November but colder-than-average temperatures predicted for December 2024 and January 2025, raising concerns for a possible ice/iron Dzud situation.

    "description": "Heavy rainfall across Afghanistan on 29 and 30 March has destroyed more than 1,500 acres of agricultural land and resulted in severe damage to over 540 homes, as well as other critical infrastructure across seven provinces, including six bridges and 450 km of road. Based on initial reports and assessments, the provinces where most damage has been reported are Faryab province in the Northern region, Nangarhar province in the Eastern region, and Daikundi province in the Central Highlands region. This is the third time that the Northern region has experienced flooding in less than a month, with seven people killed and 384 families affected in heavy rains that occurred on 21 and 26-27 March. As of 30 March, there have been no reports of displacement due to the floods. ([OCHA, 30 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4050982))\n\n[...] The health facility in the Kamgal area suffered damage due to a landslide, impacting local access to essential health services. In Kunar, the primary route between Wama and Parun was temporarily obstructed on March 30 by rockslides, disrupting transportation and relief access. Similarly, in Nuristan, the Neshagram village road to Waygal district has been blocked due to landslides, severing the connection of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 families with essential services and the district center. ([IMC, 3 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4051935))\n\nBetween 10 and 16 April 2024, Afghanistan experienced heavy rains and flash floods across the central, central highlands, northern, northeastern, southern and western regions. Preliminary reports indicate that almost 1,590 families have been affected, with 35 people killed and another 47 people injured, while 46 families have been displaced. The most severely affected provinces that had fatalities were Badghis (4), Farah (2), Hilmand (5), Kabul (3), Kandahar (4), Laghman (2), Nangahar (1), Parwan (2) and Uruzgan (12). Additionally, more than 930 houses have been destroyed (198) or damaged (738), along with around 63,700 acres of agricultural land and at least 470 livestock reportedly killed.A new wave of rains is expected in the central, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country over the next week, with up  to 30 mm of rainfall daily. These volumes are of concern because water reserves are filled to capacity, thus flooding is to be anticipated. ([OCHA, 18 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4055633))\n\nThe humanitarian impact continues to rise following heavy rainfall and floods that have been affecting several provinces of Afghanistan, particularly Badghis, Uruzgan, Farah, Paktia, Zabul, Helmand, Kunar, Kabul, Badakhshan, Ghor, Kandahar, Takhar, Parwan, Herat, Ghazni, Laghman, Nimroz, and Sar-e-Pol. As of 23 April, media report at least 90 fatalities, and dozens of injured people. In addition, more than 2,000 houses have been damaged, and thousands of livestock have died across the country. ([ECHO, 24 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4057335))\n\nOn 10 and 11 May, heavy rainfall and flash floods struck northeastern Afghanistan, affecting 21 districts across Badakhshan (5), Baghlan (10) and Takhar (6) provinces. Initial reports indicate 180 fatalities and more than 240 injuries across the three provinces. 8,975 homes were either destroyed or damaged leaving thousands without shelter. In addition to damage and destruction to roads, bridges, and public schools, 11 health facilities across Baghlan and Takhar provinces have been affected disrupting health and nutrition services, and 4,260 livestock have been lost. ([OCHA, 12 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4061685/))\n\nHeavy rainfall in central Afghanistan has caused a new wave of flash floods on the 17 May 2024. This is while the country still reeling from last week's devastating floods. The newly affected provinces are Ghor, Faryad, Sar-e Pul, Samangan, Balkh and Badghis. ([IFRC, 18 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4063373/))\n\nOn 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings. In northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. ([OCHA, 20 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4063512/))\n\nHumanitarian partners are ramping up response efforts following 10 and 11 May heavy rainfall and flash floods in Baghlan, Badakhshan and Takhar provinces that affected more than 60,000 people.

This resulted in significant impacts from episodic floods, hailstorms, and landslides in various areas, including Mbale, Kapchorwa, Bulambuli, Bukedea, Butaleja, Sironko, Bududa, and Namisindwa. A total of 18,323 people were affected, including thousands of displaced families, with 1,129 houses and several crop lands and infrastructures completely destroyed. The rains intensified in the first half of May, causing water levels to rise and rivers such as Manafwa, Lwakhakha, Sironko, Mpologoma, Awoja, Nbuyonga, and Namatala to overflow, increasing the water flow from the slopes of Mount Elgon. Unprecedented flooding occurred, especially between May 7th and 11th, exacerbating the impacts experienced throughout April. By mid-May, 39,185 people had been affected by the floods, compounding the already dire humanitarian situation from April. Further, Ntoroko district witnessed its ever-recorded highest levels of flooding in August whose assessment reveals that 2,355 households comprising of 11,775 people have been greatly impacted.

According to humanitarian partners, as of 19 June, 15 people died due to landslides. ([ECHO, 21 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4072040)) \n\nFollowing the heavy rainfall and widespread floods brought by heavy rainfall, the amount of humanitarian impact increased in Bangladesh, particularly across the districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in north-eastern Bangladesh and in Cox's Bazar area, south-eastern Bangladesh. According to CARE International, the death toll stands at ten while 260,000 people have been displaced and sheltered in more than 1,000 shelters and 3.74 million people have been affected. In addition, UNICEF reports that 772,000 children are at risk of drowning, malnutrition, and waterborne diseases. ([ECHO, 1 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4074244))\n\nTorrential rains and upstream flow resulted in the flooding of lower areas in 15 districts and left thousands of people stranded.

    "description": "The military-controlled Ministry of Health has confirmed the presence of cholera in Yangon in an official statement. As of 17 July, there are 77 confirmed cases of hospitalisation. According to other reports, cholera cases have also been identified in Rakhine, Chin and East Bago regions, with local media reporting over 240 hospitalisations. The World Health Organization (WHO) is providing training to local health workers, while the in-country water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) humanitarian cluster has a response plan that includes a rapid response team, capacity building, water supply and provision of non-food items (NFIs). Rapid assessment is partially hindered by ongoing conflict and access restrictions across the country. DG ECHO is assessing the situation and possible response together with humanitarian partners. ([ECHO, 17 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4078742))\n\nSince late June, severe diarrhea cases have been admitted to hospitals in some townships in the eastern district of Yangon, including Thaketa Township. As of 23 July 2024, a total of 1,645 cases were hospitalized with Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD), of which 269 had severe dehydration. WHO is supporting the response to the outbreak in collaboration with partners. ([WHO, 07 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4084964/))\n\n[...] According to the SAC ministerial authorities for health, a total of 2,261 hospitalized cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) and 161 hospitalized cases of AWD with severe dehydration were reported from 44 townships in Yangon Region, as of 8 August. Among them, 15 cases died and the cause of the deaths is unknown. The most affected townships were Botahtaung, Dawbon, Hlaingtharyar, Thaketa and Thingangyun. [...]  During the last week of July, more than 40 severe diarrhoea cases including suspected cases of cholera were identified in IDP camps and villages in Sittwe Township in Rakhine State.  ([OCHA, 16 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4086811))\n\nAccording to the ministerial authorities for health, as of 18 August 2024, a total of 2 957 hospitalized cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) including 160 cases with severe dehydration were reported in Yangon Region, since 24 June 2024. [...] As per information from open sources, it has been reported that cases are on the rise again in some townships. According to the early warning and response systems (EWARS) supported by the Health Cluster in Myanmar, an increase of AWD cases has been observed in Sittwe in Rakhine State. A notable surge of cases, including those with severe dehydration, has been observed since late July. Cholera infection is confirmed in some of those AWD cases. During the most recent epidemiological week (week 34, from18 to 24 August), a total of 364 new AWD cases were reported, including 22 AWD cases with severe dehydration. This represents an increase compared to the 197 AWD cases reported in the previous week (week 33, from 11 to 17 August). The AWD cases were reported from both camps and residential areas in Sittwe. ([WHO, 28 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091882))\n\nAccording to the ministerial authorities, 154 severe cases and 15 deaths were reported in Yangon among 3,421 cases between 24 June and 8 August (causes of 15 deaths were uncertain and may not be linked to severe AWD/cholera), while there were no reports of severe case and death after 8 August. According to the ministerial authorities for health, from 4 to 25 August 2024, a total of 235 hospitalized AWD cases including 63 cases with severe dehydration were reported in Sittwe, Rakhine. ([WHO, 9 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093294))\n\nA cluster of AWD cases including cases with severe outcomes were observed around Kyaikkhami Township, Mon State. With the severe flooding caused by the remnants of the [Typhoon Yagi](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2024-000161-phl) in the context of ongoing monsoon, the risk of AWD, including potential transmission of cholera, is heightened in flood-affected areas. 2.4 million doses of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) arrived in Myanmar for the vaccination campaign, which started in Yangon Region on 22 September 2024. After 25 August 2024, no official data on AWD cases and deaths were shared publicly. In Yangon, in the epidemiological week 38 (15-21 September 2024), a total of 5 AWD cases were recorded, 72% decrease compared the week 37 (8-14 September 2024); the reasons for sudden decrease of AWD cases are not well understood. ([WHO, 25 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097264/))\n\nAccording to the ministerial authorities for health, in Yangon Region, a total of 576 hospitalized cases of acute watery diarrhea were reported from 9 September to 6 October 2024. Reactive vaccination campaign using oral cholera vaccine (OCV) was carried out in Yangon Region, where a total of 2,451,847 doses of were received to cover 34 townships. A total of 70,243 OCV doses of OCV were re-allocated to three townships in Mon State, with approval from the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for vaccine provision. As of 15 October, 32,309 people have received the vaccine. ([WHO, 16 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4102493/))\n\nAccording to the ministerial authorities for health, in Yangon Region, a total of 250 hospitalized cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) were reported in the week 43 (20 to 27 October 2024). No severe cases have been reported. In Rakhine, the weekly number of AWD cases rose again to 137 in week 43 (20 to 26 October), from 18 cases in week 42 (13 to 19 October). In week 43, a total of 44 severe dehydration cases were reported. Among these 44 cases, 18 were reported in children under 5 years of age. According to the ministerial authorities for health, a total of 5 hospitalized cases of AWD, including two severe cases, were reported in week 43 (20 to 27 October) in Mon State. According to the ministerial authorities for health, in some townships of Mandalay Region, a total of 370 hospitalized cases of AWD including 218 severe cases were reported in week 43 (20 to 27 October). According to the ministerial authorities for health, in some townships of Ayeyarwady Region, a total of 28 hospitalized AWD cases, including seven severe cases, were reported in week 43 (20 to 27 October). ([WHO, 6 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108562/))\n\nThe ministerial authorities for health publicly shared the following data on acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases on 11 November 2024. In Yangon Region, a total of 205 hospitalized cases of AWD were reported from 3 to 10 November 2024. No severe cases have been reported. The weekly numbers of hospitalized AWD cases in the last few weeks are lower compared to the level observed in August (fewer than 300 cases in recent weeks, while over 400 cases in the weeks in August). However, the data indicates that pathogens causing AWD continues to circulate in Yangon. In Mon State, a total of 26 hospitalized cases of AWD were reported from 3 to 10 November 2024. No severe cases have been reported. In Mandalay Region, a total of 344 hospitalized cases of AWD including 167 cases with severe dehydration were reported from 3 to 10 November 2024. In Ayeyarwady Region, no new cases were reported between 03 to 10 November 2024 (28 hospitalized AWD cases, including seven severe cases, were reported from 20 to 27 October 2).

    "description": "Heavy rain since 26 September caused flooding and landslides in many parts of the country, particularly in central and western Nepal. According to the Nepal Police, 104 people were killed, 64 people have gone missing, and 73 people have been injured. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people were killed by landslides and flash floods. At least 1,545 families are displaced. Security forces have been mobilized for ongoing search and rescue operations. The municipality, National Red Cross Society, and civil societies are responding to the affected population. Landslides have blocked many highways, and the roads reaching Kathmandu, the capital city are all blocked. ([ECHO, 29 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097674))\n\nThe death toll and damage caused by heavy rain that has resulted in flooding and landslides in central and western Nepal is increasing. According to media, as of 30 September, at least 193 people died, including 34 in the capital Kathmandu, 31 are still missing, and 96 have been injured. In addition, three highways have been blocked by landslides isolating Kathmandu, and schools have been closed. ([ECHO, 30 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097835))\n\nAccording to media reports, as of 1 October, 217 people died, including 35 due to a landslide in Dhading district, in Bagmati province, southern Nepal. National authorities and Save the Children report that 111 people have been injured, 4,000 have been rescued, a total of 540 people have been displaced, and 5,000 have been affected. In addition, more than 54 schools and four bridges have been damaged, and 23 highways have been affected.  ([ECHO, 1 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098189))\n\nThe rainfall recorded on 26 and 27 September has been identified as the heaviest ever recorded in Nepal's history. In response, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) activated its Simplified Early Action Protocol (sEAP) following a decision made during the advisory committee meeting (comprising NRCS and IFRC representatives) on 26 September. The sEAP was triggered to support communities living in the Babai and West Rapati river basins in the western part of the country. ([IFRC, 3 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4098960))\n\nOne week after the onset of heavy rainfall in Nepal, more than 81,000 people are estimated to be affected by floods and landslides. It is estimated that more than 230 people, including 55 children (20 girls and 35 boys) have died, with many others injured or reported missing. An estimated 4,667 houses are fully destroyed while 5,310 houses are partially damaged. Landslides and rubble have blocked major roads into the Katmandu Valley, hampering access to goods and critical services, including healthcare. Reports of increase in food prices and other essential items in the valley have begun. Access to critical services is affected, with 62 health facilities, 550 water supply systems, and 9,000 sanitation facilities damaged. UNICEF is concerned about possible disease outbreaks, including cholera and dengue fever. More than 190 schools have been damaged, affecting 23,000 students. ([UNICEF, 4 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099089/))\n\nAs of 03 October, 236 people have been killed, 173 injured, and 19 remain missing, while 17,120 have been rescued. The estimated damage includes NPR 4.35 billion to energy infrastructure, NPR 2.5 billion to roads and bridges, and over NPR 6 billion to agriculture. Hydropower projects, schools, health facilities, and communications have been severely affected across impacted areas. [...] While the floodwater in affected areas is receding, the risk of communicable disease outbreaks is heightened, including waterborne (Acute Gastroenteritis, Cholera, Hepatitis-A/E), rodent-borne (Leptospirosis), vector-borne (Dengue, Malaria), and vaccine-preventable diseases (Tetanus, Measles). Overcrowding in displacement camps also raises concerns about COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks, while health service disruptions may impact treatment for TB, HIV, and other diseases. ([UN RC Nepal, 7 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099545/))\n\nThe humanitarian impact has increased following widespread floods and landslides that have affected several parts of Nepal since 26 September.

More than 17,000 people have been rescued through various rescue operations that deployed more than 30 thousand security personnel. The Nepal Government has declared 71 municipalities across 20 districts as disaster crisis/emergency zones due to the severe impacts of landslides and floods. ([Govt. of Nepal, 16 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103889))\n\nAs of 5 November 2024, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) conducted a detailed assessment in 6 of the most affected and targeted districts namely, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhuli, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Ramechhhap and Panchthar in October 2024. The teams on the ground have reported more than 5,300 households (approximately 26,500 people) across these districts have been affected. Due to the severe impact of the floods and landslides, the affected families still do not have access to basic services like water, transportation, communication and electricity services have not been restored in some of the remote areas. According to the NRCS District Chapters, most of the displaced families are staying in the rented houses, few of them are still living under tarpaulin or with their relatives.

    "description": "Tropical cyclone OSCAR continued inland over south-eastern Cuba on 21 October, as a tropical storm, further weakening. On 22 October at 6.00 UTC its centre was located over the North Atlantic Ocean approximately 70 km south-west of the Crooked Island, far southern Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (tropical storm).\nIts passage over south-eastern Cuba caused heavy rainfall and resulted in casualties and damage. Media reports, as 22 October, six fatalities across the San Antonio del Sur community, Guantanamo province. Several municipalities received more than 300 mm of rain, causing heavy flooding, severe damage to infrastructure and the blocking of roads and highways. Over the next 24 hours, heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges are still forecast over south-eastern Cuba and central and southern Bahamas. ([ECHO, 22 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4103682))\n\nFollowing Hurricane Oscar, the UN in Cuba launched a Plan of Action, developed with national authorities, to support immediate response and early recovery. This plan, which seeks US$33 million to assist 478,000 people, will address urgent needs over the first six months, with select projects extending up to 18 months for recovery. [...]\n\nApproximately 150,000 people face urgent needs in areas like Baracoa, Maisí, Imías, and San Antonio del Sur, where widespread flooding hampers rescue efforts and access to water, food, and health services. Power outages are disrupting communications and emergency response. The storm damaged over 14,300 homes, many at risk of roof collapse, along with 56 health facilities, 150 schools, and critical water systems. More than 15,000 hectares of crops were lost, affecting food storage and local livelihoods, including salt and coffee production. ([OCHA, 04 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4107734/))\n\nHurricane Oscar has left nearly 60,000 people affected by various damages to their homes: total and partial collapses, as well as the total or partial loss of roofs. Around 90,000 people, including those whose homes were damaged, have lost basic living and subsistence needs such as mattresses, cooking facilities, hygiene, and lack of electricity due to the impact of the floods. The impact of the floods has been greatest in Imías (which is still cut off) and in San Antonio del Sur municipalities. [...]\n\nGuantánamo province was the hardest hit by Hurricane Oscar. Serious damage was reported in the agricultural sector, in more than 4,000 hectares of vegetables, 750 hectares of bananas, and 1,117 tons of beans. In the agroforestry sector, 4,648 ha of coffee, 3,782 ha of cocoa, and 153 ha of coconut were damaged. In the livestock sector, damage was reported to the roofs of facilities related to small livestock, while in the fishing sector, damage occurred to the infrastructure of fishery product processing centers. In the 4 municipalities of San Antonio del Sur, Imías, Maísi and Baracoa, 1,786 hectares of crops were lost, as well as more than 200 hectares of seedbeds that supported 2,000 hectares of sowing, which includes 27 cultivation houses in the Caujerí Valley module, and 32,800 cans of coffee. In the banana sector, it is estimated that almost 50% of the plantations have been damaged, reaching 70 or 80% in Baracoa and Maisí.

The maximum sustained winds are currently at 95 kilometers per hour, although a significant increase in its strength and large swells is expected as the system approaches the southern waters of Cuba.\n\nFive western provinces and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud remain under cyclone alert, with over 3.8 million people potentially exposed to the impacts of the system.\n\nAt the same time, the central and eastern regions of the country are experiencing the effects of intense rainfall associated with a trough. Both Tropical Storm Rafael and the trough arrive less than three weeks after the eastern part of Cuba, particularly the province of Guantánamo, suffered the impacts of Hurricane Oscar, which resulted in eight fatalities, two people missing, and substantial material damage.\n\nThe trajectory forecasts for the new storm predominantly cover the provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Río, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, but they also predict potential damage in the capital city, which would pose risks to infrastructure and housing. Significant impacts on agriculture, livelihoods, and electrical infrastructure are also anticipated amid a complex energy situation. ([OCHA, 05 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4108146/))\n\n48 hours after the impact of Hurricane Rafael in western and central Cuba, preliminary figures show significant damage to homes, electrical infrastructure and basic services, as well as agriculture, in a context of ongoing response to Hurricane Oscar, which affected eastern Cuba three weeks ago. [...] \n\nSo far, no human losses have been reported, and specialized brigades have been deployed from nearby provinces to support the recovery, including the restoration of basic services and cleaning up debris. The greatest damage is concentrated in the province of Artemisa, where the hurricane severely impacted its 11 municipalities. The intense damage includes the demolition of 10 electricity towers. Several communities are cut off or very difficult to access due to falling trees and power lines, as well as flooding and overflowing rivers. ([UNCT Cuba, 08 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4109177/))\n\nApproximately 800,000 people have suffered the damages caused by this powerful hurricane in the most exposed territories of Artemisa, Mayabeque, Havana and Isla de la Juventud. [...] \n\nFollowing Hurricane Rafael, severe damage to the electrical system caused the water supply to be affected in the western provinces. A week after the impact, in the province of Artemisa, only 17% of the inhabitants had recovered the water supply service and in Havana, only 20%. In Mayabeque, the interruption of electricity service and water pumping continued in the municipalities of Batabanó, Quivicán, Melena del Sur and Nueva Paz. [...]\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Rafael has so far left (damage is still quantified), some 25,471 homes with various damages, concentrating its impact in the province of Artemisa with more than 83% of the damage. Severe effects predominate considering the ravages of strong category 3 winds. As a result, some 92,000 victims have been identified. At the same time, around 60,000 people (20,000 families) have been identified with severe problems in accessing electricity; they have had coverage with small photovoltaic systems as an immediate alternative, among others to access water. At the same time, damage to the conventional power grid has affected an additional 305,000 people. [...]\n\nWith Hurricane Rafael, a total of 144 health institutions were damaged in the three affected provinces of the western region. These include 28 hospitals, 43 polyclinics, 123 family doctor's offices and 51 other types of clinics. In Artemisa, significant damage is reported in two hospitals, the José Ramón Martínez Pediatric Hospital in Guanajay and the Ciro Redondo García General Hospital in the municipality of Artemisa.

Over the next 24 hours, MAN-YI is forecast to continue eastwards strengthening. On 15-16 November, it could turn north-eastwards and it could approach central and northern Philippines on 17 November as a very strong typhoon. MAN-YI will be the sixth tropical cyclone since 20 October which will affect the Philippines, particularly the central and northern regions.

    "description": "The situation in the Dominican Republic remains critical as heavy rains continue to saturate soils after several days of persistent rainfall. According to meteorological forecasts, the country is under the influence of two cold fronts and two troughs that will affect the weather during the next days, which will generate a significant rainy period in a large part of the country. Furthermore, the recent opening of dam floodgates has increased river and stream flows, raising the risk of overflows and potential flooding in both urban and rural areas. With additional rainfall expected in the coming days, soil saturation is likely to intensify. The heavy rainfall will increase the risk of flash floods, as well as flooding of rivers and ravines, especially in the north, northeast, Central Cordillera, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country. Authorities are closely monitoring conditions and adjusting alerts to respond to this high-risk scenario. ([IFRC, 19 Nov 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4111805))",

    "description": "Since October 29, 2024, there has been a marked increase in fire intensity, particularly in the Homs and Lattakia governorates. The majority of the fires have been reported in rugged mountainous and remote areas. The size and severity of certain bushfires have produced localized weather phenomena, that trap heat and generate strong winds, further exacerbating the fire situation. High wind conditions have facilitated the rapid spread of the flames, with some fires crossing highways and roads. The lack of capacity for the firemen such as vehicles and fuel are some of many other factors affecting the capacities of public services due to the continuities of Syrian crisis including the impact of different inputs (the Middle East crisis, the sanctions, climate change, etc.). Separate fires also occurred in Tartous governate however the scale of those fires was contained with minimal impact on the local population, while the fires in Homs and Lattakia could not be contained in the same manner. Until 03 November, the scale of the wildfires was limited to mountains in both the regions which grew in the following 2-3 days affecting the local population and its livelihoods.
