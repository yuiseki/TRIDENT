    "description": "Following the severe impacts of the El Nino induced drought which affected more than 80% of the country resulting in significantly below-normal harvest, the country declared the 2023-2024 agriculture season a state of national disaster at the beginning of April 2024. The government appealed to humanitarian partners for resource mobilization to alleviate the possible impacts of the drought. ([WFP, 19 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4056008))\n\nAn estimated population of 6 million are expected to be food insecure in Zimbabwe during 2024-2025 lean season. The current El Niño induced drought is expected to impact the food and nutrition security situation, reducing food access and diversity, and thereby the overall quality of people’s diets. Poor rainfall led to partial or complete crop failure in most parts of the country –40 percent poor and 60 percent written off (i.e. completely lost). The drought will only further worsen water shortages in Zimbabwe, exposing 2.6 million people to water insecurity. The current El Niño event threatens nearly 1.8 million learners across Zimbabwe's 72 education districts, with the most severe impacts to be felt by more than 1.24 million students, in 30 most drought-affected districts. ([OCHA, 5 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4060387))\n\nArea-level Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand in Zimbabwe from June 2024 to January 2025. Following a historic dry spell at a critical period of crop development that resulted in a very poor harvest, millions of people are expected to rely on alternative sources of income, social support, and humanitarian assistance to access food during the longer-than-normal 2024/25 lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes will be widespread from October 2024 to January 2025. Althoughthe start of the 2024/25 rainy season in late 2024 is forecast to be average and will likely support engagement in agricultural activity, humanitarian assistance needs will remain high in many areas of the country until the harvest in 2025 due to poor purchasing capacity as a result of limited income-earning opportunities and high food prices. ([FEWS NET, 3 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4075080))\n\nCrisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected throughout the country from October 2024 through May 2025. Following the 2023/24 El Niño-induced drought, own-produced food stocks are widely unavailable, even in typical surplus-producing areas, while high prices and below-average income are constraining access to markets. As a result, higher-than-normal food assistance needs are expected throughout the annual lean season.

The worst affected states are Mizoram, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya. ([ECHO, 30 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4066382/))\n\nTropical storm REMAL struck northeastern India and Bangladesh from May 26-28, causing severe flooding and landslides. In India's northeast, 39 people were reported dead, with the highest fatalities in Mizoram. Dozens remain missing, over 500 were injured, and significant displacement has occurred, with nearly 21,000 affected and 175 homes damaged across Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura. In Manipur, the storm impacted around 188,143 people and damaged over 24,000 houses. West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district saw 1.9 million people affected, thousands of homes damaged, and over 150,000 people evacuated to relief camps. Further assessments are pending. In Bangladesh, the cyclone's aftermath left 16 dead and affected 3.75 million people, according to Save the Children.

More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4074688))\n\n**Bangladesh** has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal [...] and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country [...]. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. ([UNICEF, 21 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4087939))\n\nBy September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in **Bangladesh** have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts.

    "description": "In the early hours of August 20, 2024, the Kiri Dam in Tudun Tsira, Shelleng LGA, Adamawa State, breached its banks, resulting in severe flooding across the communities of Kwakwambe, Lure, Nbalang, Imburu, and Bare in the Numan Local Government Area. The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

Over 1,083,141 individuals have been impacted by the relentless rains, leading to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. The floods have left 641,598 persons displaced, 285 people dead, and 2,504 injured. Houses, farmlands, and critical infrastructure have been devastated, with 98,242 homes affected. ([OCHA, 17 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4094779))\n\nBetween July and September 2024, 29 states across the nation experienced exceptionally high rainfall, compounded by the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Maiduguri area of Borno State, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to widespread flooding, the collapse of bridges, closure of schools, and restricted access to hospitals and markets. The resulting devastation has caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, crops, and shelters, critically disrupting livelihoods and displacing thousands of households. The latest report by UNOCHA confirms that at least one million people have been affected, with 311 lives lost and more than 3,174 injured. A total of 390,000 people have been displaced, forced to flee with only the belongings they could carry, but now finding themselves in deplorable conditions, without sufficient safeguards and exposed to heightened protection risks. Roughly 245,500 people are living in collective shelters or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, with 2,867 communities impacted across 29 states. Over 6,490,307 square metres (649.0307 hectares) of farmland have been destroyed by the floods, foreshadowing severe humanitarian consequences.

As a result, and in response to ongoing efforts to reduce and consolidate temporary relocation sites, the number of people displaced by flooding has reduced from about 400,000 people housed in 36 sites at the height of the crisis to 150,000 people in 22 sites, as of 24 September. ([OCHA, 25 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4096848/))\n\nAlmost four weeks after the collapse of the Alau Dam and subsequent flash floods in Borno State, flood waters have receded in the worst-hit Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere local government areas (LGAs) offering some respite to affected people. Many are returning to their homes and to host communities, while those whose homes remain submerged are being relocated to larger, more centralized temporary sites within the State. The reduction and consolidation of temporary relocation sites is ongoing to better manage the situation and to ensure the return of public facilities such as schools to their intended purpose. Several schools in Borno had been repurposed to accommodate flood-affected people.  Humanitarian needs, however, remain critical despite the significant reduction in the number of displaced people living in emergency shelters, from a peak of 400,000 people at the height of flooding to about 50,000 registered individuals as of 4 October, according to the Borno State Government (BSG) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).
