    "description": "On 23 March Cuba experienced intense rains and local thunderstorms that have swept through the entire western and central regions of the country before advancing towards the Eastern Region later that afternoon. The provinces most severely impacted thus far are Artemisa, Mayabeque, Matanzas, and Havana. Havana, in particular, has witnessed significant incidents of severe flooding, caused by the overflowing of the Luyano River. The torrential downpours have inflicted damage across various sectors, including infrastructure, with partial and total roof collapses, disruptions to the power grid affecting over 270,000 individuals, agricultural losses, and livelihood setbacks. As of 25 March, the UN Country Team in Cuba has reported the evacuation of nearly 1,000 individuals in the capital, primarily due to multiple landslides.
