    "description": "On 24 July, the combined effects of the Southwest Monsoon, enhanced by Tropical Cyclone Gaemi(local name: Carina), brought heavy to intense rains across the Philippines. Northern Luzon, particularly the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Ilocos Norte, experienced severe impacts, while Central Luzon provinces Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija faced severe flooding and power outages. In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exitingthe Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA.  ([OCHA, 24 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4080598))\n\nSuper Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July.
