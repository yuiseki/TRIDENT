    "description": "Following the severe impacts of the El Nino induced drought which affected more than 80% of the country resulting in significantly below-normal harvest, the country declared the 2023-2024 agriculture season a state of national disaster at the beginning of April 2024. The government appealed to humanitarian partners for resource mobilization to alleviate the possible impacts of the drought. ([WFP, 19 Apr 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4056008))\n\nAn estimated population of 6 million are expected to be food insecure in Zimbabwe during 2024-2025 lean season. The current El Niño induced drought is expected to impact the food and nutrition security situation, reducing food access and diversity, and thereby the overall quality of people’s diets. Poor rainfall led to partial or complete crop failure in most parts of the country –40 percent poor and 60 percent written off (i.e. completely lost). The drought will only further worsen water shortages in Zimbabwe, exposing 2.6 million people to water insecurity. The current El Niño event threatens nearly 1.8 million learners across Zimbabwe's 72 education districts, with the most severe impacts to be felt by more than 1.24 million students, in 30 most drought-affected districts. ([OCHA, 5 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4060387))\n\nArea-level Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand in Zimbabwe from June 2024 to January 2025. Following a historic dry spell at a critical period of crop development that resulted in a very poor harvest, millions of people are expected to rely on alternative sources of income, social support, and humanitarian assistance to access food during the longer-than-normal 2024/25 lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes will be widespread from October 2024 to January 2025. Althoughthe start of the 2024/25 rainy season in late 2024 is forecast to be average and will likely support engagement in agricultural activity, humanitarian assistance needs will remain high in many areas of the country until the harvest in 2025 due to poor purchasing capacity as a result of limited income-earning opportunities and high food prices. ([FEWS NET, 3 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4075080))\n\nCrisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected throughout the country from October 2024 through May 2025. Following the 2023/24 El Niño-induced drought, own-produced food stocks are widely unavailable, even in typical surplus-producing areas, while high prices and below-average income are constraining access to markets. As a result, higher-than-normal food assistance needs are expected throughout the annual lean season.

    "description": "A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclonic storm “Remal” and it is expected to make landfall near West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts around midnight between 26 and 27 May. Wind speed ranging 90-120 kmph (with a maximum up to 135) and a surge height ranging 3-4 m are expected in the coastal areas of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Hatia, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barisal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. There is a particular alert for Rohingya camps and hill districts for heavy rainfall and subsequent landslide risks. The overall potential exposed population is 1.9 million, who may be displaced during the cyclone, with almost 0.5 million houses estimated to be possibly damaged or destroyed. ([ECHO, 26 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065093/))\n\nA tropical storm named REMAL formed over the northern Bay of Bengal on 25 May. It made landfall over the border area between India, West Bengal state and Bangladesh, Khulna division on 26 May around 18.00 UTC. Tidal surges as high as 12 feet, heavy rainfall, and wind speeds of up to 120 km/h have led to inundation of many southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters. Tens of thousands of volunteers had been mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) to quicken the evacuation efforts and relief has already been transported to remote areas. 10,599 houses are so far reported fully destroyed, while 18,605 are reported partially destroyed, and 9 people are reported dead. Millions are without power. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected over West Bengal and most of Bangladesh. ([ECHO, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065276/))\n\nAs of 28 May, ten casualties are reported across southern Bangladesh and six more in the West Bengal state (India). Around 800,000 are displaced across Bangladesh and 150,000 in India. Approximately 3.75 million of affected people in both countries. Around 115,000 houses were reported damaged in India and 35,000 destroyed in Bangladesh, fostering high risk of protracted displacement.

([ECHO, 29 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065963/))\n\nThe humanitarian impact is increasing after the passage of tropical storm REMAL which made landfall near the Bangladesh-India border and crossed north-eastern India on 26-28 May. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 29 May, in Bangladesh 16 people died, 807,023 people have been evacuated to 9,424 evacuation centres and almost 3.5 million people have been affected. In addition, 40,246 houses were completely damaged, and 131,678 others were partially damaged. The rain and high tides damaged some embankments and flooded coastal areas in the Sundarbans. Rain brought by the cyclone, flooded roads also in the capital Dhaka. In India, media report at least 37 fatalities, most of them in Mizoram State, dozens missing people, and hundreds of evacuated. The worst affected states are Mizoram, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya. ([ECHO, 30 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4066382/))\n\nTropical storm REMAL struck northeastern India and Bangladesh from May 26-28, causing severe flooding and landslides. In India's northeast, 39 people were reported dead, with the highest fatalities in Mizoram. Dozens remain missing, over 500 were injured, and significant displacement has occurred, with nearly 21,000 affected and 175 homes damaged across Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura. In Manipur, the storm impacted around 188,143 people and damaged over 24,000 houses. West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district saw 1.9 million people affected, thousands of homes damaged, and over 150,000 people evacuated to relief camps. Further assessments are pending. In Bangladesh, the cyclone's aftermath left 16 dead and affected 3.75 million people, according to Save the Children. Approximately 150,000 homes were hit, affecting 639,000 people, including many children. ([ECHO, 31 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4066693/))\n\nIn **India**, 10 days after the cyclone Remal made a landfall, there has been random episodes of unseasonal rainfall in the affected area. As per media reports 07 people have lost their lives and nearly 100 people have been injured as a consequence of the cyclone. People continue to live in damaged and uninhabitable conditions with unusable toilet facility conditions. Some local donor agencies have supported with tarpaulin sheets which is providing temporary relief. There were more than 1,400 relief camps functional during the cyclone, now they have been closed and people have returned to their homes, many of which have been partially or completely destroyed. As per government reports from the district of South 24 Parganas, 23 blocks, 249 Gram Panchayats (village level government administration), 1,905,032 people are affected. Government has distributed 70,914 tarpaulins and 153,353 fresh cooked meals to the impacted people. ([UNICEF, 7 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4068624))\n\nIn **Bangladesh**, according to the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), about 4.6 million people were affected by Cyclone Remal in 19 districts, and 16 people died across seven districts. Approximately 807,023 people were evacuated to 9,424 evacuation shelters across 19 districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. About 80,591 hectares of cultivable land were inundated. Additionally, 50,000 fish enclosures, 34,000 ponds, and 4,000 crab farms were severely flooded, disrupting food supply chains, and exacerbating livelihoods and food insecurity. More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4074688))\n\n**Bangladesh** has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal [...] and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country [...]. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. ([UNICEF, 21 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4087939))\n\nBy September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in **Bangladesh** have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts.
