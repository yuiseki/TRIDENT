    "description": "Starting in the evening of Sunday, 19/11/2023, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was exposed to a severe depression with the noon hours affecting all the kingdomâ€™s governorates dropping the temperatures to below 10 degrees. The Meteorological Agency issued warnings of strong winds exceeding in some areas the barrier of 65 km / h, which leads to rising dust and low horizontal visibility, especially in the Badia regions. The rate of rainfall fell greater than usual at this time of the year, which led to the formation of torrential rains in cities, valleys, and water catchment areas, according to the report of the Ministry of Water. [...] These harsh winter conditions have impacted and continue to impact many community groups in the north and south of Jordan. Some households in Ma'an (South of Jordan) and Irbid (North of Jordan) governorates were raided by floodwaters causing damage to some of their household items with no injuries or deaths according to the social sources. Tented settlements in remote areas were heavily impacted with their tents flooded with water and were evacuated to emergency shelters by the civil defense. [...] \nThe affected people include vulnerable Jordanians, Syrian refugees (with different registration statuses), Iraqi refugees, Pakistani workers, and Sudanese and Yemeni asylum seekers. These groups either live in very poor conditions in households that need renovation or are living in informal tented settlements. Even though these groups are identified by the different humanitarian actors in the field, their ability to intervene to support them is still very limited.

    "description": "[...] For successive years, Eswatini has been battling with prolonged drought whose effect on agriculture were further escalated by socio-economic cumulative challenges that the country did not overcome. ACAPS classification of the food insecurity in Eswatini on 30th November was high. 25% of the population is concerned by the food insecurity vulnerabilities with challenge accessing food needs and water insecure, with many households still reliant on welfare and social safety nets. \n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report published on August 2023 indicates that approximately 238,500 people (20%) of the population were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent humanitarian assistance in September 2023. From October 2023 to March 2024, it was projected that approximately 268,000 people will be classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), and nearly 14,700 will be in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). On average 25% will be facing acute food insecurity in the predicted period. The regions with the highest prevalence of food insecurity are Lubombo and Shiswelweni, the areas most affected by the drought.\n\nThe magnitude of the drought and its consequences on food security escalation in the country will worsen with the forecasted El Nino (January - March period). Seasonal forecasts released by the SADC Meteorological Center and the local meteorological department predict a high inclination to the El Nino phenomenon in the January to March period.
