    "description": "Humanitarian partners expect floods in the second half of 2024, with a peak from September to December. This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses. ([IFRC, 1 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4083163))\n\nContinuous heavy rains since May, combined with controlled water releases from Lake Victoria, have significantly raised Nile River levels, affecting up to 472,000 people across 26 of South Sudan's 78 counties and Abyei Administrative Area. The floods have devastated homes, destroyed crops, disrupted education and health services, and restricted access to essential facilities. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091161))\n\nAs of 12 September, flooding has affected over 735,000 people across 38 of South Sudan’s 78 counties and the Abyei Administrative Area. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 65,000 people have been displaced, with over 41,000 in Warrap State alone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to aid 700,000 flood-affected people in five severely impacted counties. The South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated $5 million to complement this effort. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093561))\nFlooding has affected over 890,000 people across the country. The latest increase is attributed to newly confirmed numbers of affected people in the Abyei Administrative Area, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states. About 226,000 people are flood-displaced, including 114,480 reported from Unity State alone. Due to damaged and impassable roads, physical access to affected communities remains a challenge. On 3 October, the Council of Ministers endorsed the declaration of a state of emergency in flood-affected states. ([OCHA, 4 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099213))",

The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock.

Over 200 rivers overflowed, with Northern Moravia, particularly Jeseník, Opava, and Ostrava, among the hardest-hit areas. The rain totals in parts of Jeseník exceeded 500 mm (20 inches), surpassing previous flood records. Roads, railways, and bridges suffered extensive damage, especially in Ostrava, where train services were suspended. These regions experienced severe flooding, leading to the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people were evacuated, and approximately 250,000 were left without electricity. [...] The situation remains critical in parts of the South Bohemian Region, where ongoing threats of further flooding persist. As of 19 September, five fatalities were reported, along with widespread displacement of about 10,000 residents. ([IFRC, 25 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097173/))\n\nHeavy rains brought by Storm Boris have caused severe flooding in southwestern **Poland**, particularly affecting the voivodeships of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Slaskie, and Malopolskie. Rivers like the Morawka have overflowed, and some dams have collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. On 16 September, the Council of Ministers declared a \"state of natural disaster\" for a period of 30 days in parts of the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian voivodeships. [...] As of 19 September 2024, seven people have been confirmed dead due to the flooding. The Prime Minister's Office reported that the disaster has directly affected 57,000 people, with 6,544 residents evacuated as waters continue to rise. ([IFRC, 26 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4097267))\n\nThe 2024 Central European floods in **Romania** were triggered by Storm Boris, which brought torrential rains to the counties of Galați and Vaslui on 14 September. In less than 24 hours, over 150 mm of rainfall per square meter caused ash floods in several areas. Galați was the hardest hit, with flood waters reaching depths of 1.5 to 2 meters in the localities of Cudalbi, Cuza-Vodă, Pechea, Slobozia-Conachi, Tudor Vladimirescu, and Costache Negri. In Vaslui, the southern localities of Zorleni, Grivița, and Trestiana were most affected. The floods caused widespread destruction, severely damaging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power systems, and schools. More than 6,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed across both counties. Around 400 people remain displaced and are currently being sheltered in temporary housing provided by authorities. Tragically, seven deaths have been confirmed.

About half of Poland was affected by these big waters! The Prime Minister's office says more than 57,000 people needed help because they had no safe place left due to the floods.",
      "- Meanwhile in **Romania**, even deeper water rains made rivers rise high (like up to 2 meters!) on September 14th and caused a lot of damage there too - homes were ruined or destroyed which means people lost their places to live! In some spots called Cudalbi, Cuza-Vodă, Pechea... these areas had the most problems. There are about as many houses damaged here as in 19 Romanian counties at one time during a flood once every ten years or so.",
      "- Over in **Bosnia and Herzegovina**, too much rain since October began has caused big rivers to overflow with even more water than usual on October 5th! Sadly this brought mudslides that hurt people's lives; some are still missing while others got sick from the floodwaters.

According to the Nepal Police, 104 people were killed, 64 people have gone missing, and 73 people have been injured. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people were killed by landslides and flash floods. At least 1,545 families are displaced. Security forces have been mobilized for ongoing search and rescue operations. The municipality, National Red Cross Society, and civil societies are responding to the affected population.

It is estimated that more than 230 people, including 55 children (20 girls and 35 boys) have died, with many others injured or reported missing. An estimated 4,667 houses are fully destroyed while 5,310 houses are partially damaged. Landslides and rubble have blocked major roads into the Katmandu Valley, hampering access to goods and critical services, including healthcare. Reports of increase in food prices and other essential items in the valley have begun. Access to critical services is affected, with 62 health facilities, 550 water supply systems, and 9,000 sanitation facilities damaged.

Overcrowding in displacement camps also raises concerns about COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks, while health service disruptions may impact treatment for TB, HIV, and other diseases.
