    "description": "Humanitarian partners expect floods in the second half of 2024, with a peak from September to December. This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses. ([IFRC, 1 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4083163))\n\nContinuous heavy rains since May, combined with controlled water releases from Lake Victoria, have significantly raised Nile River levels, affecting up to 472,000 people across 26 of South Sudan's 78 counties and Abyei Administrative Area. The floods have devastated homes, destroyed crops, disrupted education and health services, and restricted access to essential facilities. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4091161))\n\nAs of 12 September, flooding has affected over 735,000 people across 38 of South Sudan’s 78 counties and the Abyei Administrative Area. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 65,000 people have been displaced, with over 41,000 in Warrap State alone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to aid 700,000 flood-affected people in five severely impacted counties. The South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated $5 million to complement this effort. ([OCHA, 12 Sep 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4093561))\nFlooding has affected over 890,000 people across the country. The latest increase is attributed to newly confirmed numbers of affected people in the Abyei Administrative Area, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states. About 226,000 people are flood-displaced, including 114,480 reported from Unity State alone. Due to damaged and impassable roads, physical access to affected communities remains a challenge. On 3 October, the Council of Ministers endorsed the declaration of a state of emergency in flood-affected states. ([OCHA, 4 Oct 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4099213))",
