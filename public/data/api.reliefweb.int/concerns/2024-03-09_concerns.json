    "description": "Amid escalating levels of food insecurity, Timor-Leste is already showing clear signs of drought in twelve out of fourteen municipalities based on the Combined Drought Index, produced by the Government of Timor-Leste and FAO. In addition, the country is facing the looming possibility of an extended El Niño-induced dry season and predictions of sustained low rainfall into early 2024, all of which will severely impact agriculture. ([WFP,  31 Oct 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4001353/))\n\nThe United Nations in Timor-Leste announced the launch of emergency grant funding amounting to US$2 million. This funding aims to provide emergency food, water, nutrition, and agricultural assistance to people affected by El Niño in six municipalities across the country. [...] As a small island nation, Timor-Leste relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture and imported food. Since September 2023, an ongoing El Niño weather event has led to drought-like conditions, delayed rainfall, and flash floods during the country’s main planting season. ([FAO, UNICEF, UN RC Timor-Leste & WFP, 2 Feb 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4034816/))\n\nTimor-Leste is forecast to experience below-average precipitation over the next three months, extending a prolonged period of dry conditions in the country despite the wet season, which is ongoing and expected to end by April. [...] The outcomes of rice and maize production require close monitoring to address any potential food security concerns. ([OCHA,  5 Mar 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4043598))",
